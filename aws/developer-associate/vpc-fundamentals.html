    <h1>VPC Fundamentals</h1>

    <p>VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud.</p>

    <h2>VPC and Subnets</h2>
    <p>
      VPC is a virtual private cloud, this is a private network within AWS that
      allows deployment of resources within the VPC. VPCs are regional based,
      different regions have separate VPCs
    </p>
    <p>
      Subnets allow you to partition your network within your VPC, subnets are
      an availability zone resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      A subnet can be public so can access the WWW and be accessed by the WWW.
    </p>
    <p>
      A subnet can also be private so the subnet is not internet accessible.
    </p>
    <p>
      To define access to the internet and between subnets we use Route Tables.

    <h3>Internet Gateways and NAT Gateways</h3>
    <p>
      Our internet gateway allows our subnets to connect to the internet, the
      public subnet has a connection to the IGW and the IGW can connect to the
      internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we want our private subnets to access the internet we can use NAT
      gateways which are managed by AWS. This allow instances in the private
      subnet to access the internet while remaining private.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NAT gateway is deployed within our public subnet, the NAT gateway has
      a route to the IGW. The private subnet then connects to the NAT gateway in
      the public subnet.
    </p>

    <h2>Network ACL and Security Groups</h2>
    <p>
      Network ACL (access control list) is a firewall which controls traffic to
      and from the subnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NACL can have ALLOW and DENY rules that are attached at the subnet
      level, rules only include IP addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also have security groups that can control traffic to an ENI (elastic
      network interface) which in turn controls traffic to our EC2 instances.
      The security group can only have ALLOW rules and reference IP addresses or
      other security groups.

    />
    <h3>VPC Flow Logs</h3>
    <p>Captures all information about IP traffic going into your interfaces.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>VPC flow Logs</li>
      <li>Subnet flow logs</li>
      <li>Elastic network interface flow logs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Helps monitory and troubleshoot connectivity issues.</p>
    <p>
      Captures network information from AWS managed interfaces too (ELB,
      ElastiCache, RDS, etc...)
    </p>
    <p>
      VPC Flow Logs data can be sent to S3, CloudWatch, Kinesis Data Firehose.
    </p>

    <h2>VPC Peering</h2>
    <p>
      Connect two VPCs in different cloud environments or different regions
      using AWS' network. This allows them to communicate and behave as if they
      are in the same network.
    </p>
    <p>The IP ranges for each VPC CIDR cannot overlap!</p>
    <p>VPC peering connection is not transitive.</p>

    <h3>VPC Endpoints</h3>
    <p>
      VPC endpoints allow us to connect to AWS services using a private network
      instead of the public web. This gives ue enhanced security and lower
      latency to access AWS services.
    </p>

    <h3>Sit to Site VPN</h3>
    <p>Allows us to connect on premise VPN to AWS.</p>
    <p>Data is automatically encrypted over the public internet.</p>

    />

    <h3>Direct Connect (DX)</h3>
    <p>Established a physical connection between on-premises and AWS.</p>
    <p>
      The connection is private, secure and fast but takes at least a month to
      establish.
