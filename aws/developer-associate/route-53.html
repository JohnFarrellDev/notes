    <h2>DNS</h2>
    <p>
      DNS allows us to translate human readable domain names into IP addresses,
      such as google.com becoming 172.217.18.16 . The name server resolves DNS
      queries by returning the IP address for the domain dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole backbone of the internet is built on top of DNS. DNS uses
      hierarchial naming structure, root is .com, example.com is more precise
      then can go even further and go api.example.com.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something like .com or .gov is considered a top level domain (TLD), then a
      second level domain would be amazon.com
    </p>
    <p>
      Domain names must be registered with a registrar such as Amazon Route 53
      or GoDaddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      With your domain you have important DNS Records, these are A, AAAA, CNAME,
      NS.

    <p>Route 53 refers to the traditional DNS port being on 53.</p>
    <p>Your route 53 record defines how your route traffic for a domain:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Domain/subdomain Name - example.com</li>
      <li>RecordType - A, AAAA, cname</li>
      <li>Value - 123.4566.789.123</li>
      <li>Routing Policy - How route 53 responds to queries</li>
      <li>TTL - amount of time the record cached at DNS resolves</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Route 53 supports the following DNS record types: A, AAAA, CNAME, NS.</p>
    <p>These record types represent:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A - maps hostname to IPv4</li>
      <li>AAAA - maps hostname to IPv6</li>
      <li>
        <p>CNAME - maps hostname to another hostname</p>
        <ul>

          <li>
            Can't create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace
            (Zone Apex)
          </li>
          <li>
            Can't create a CNAME for example.com but can for www.example.com
