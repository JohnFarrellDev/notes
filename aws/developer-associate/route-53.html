    <h1>RDS 53</h1>

    <h2>DNS</h2>
    <p>
      DNS allows us to translate human readable domain names into IP addresses,
      such as google.com becoming 172.217.18.16 . The name server resolves DNS
      queries by returning the IP address for the domain dame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole backbone of the internet is built on top of DNS. DNS uses
      hierarchial naming structure, root is .com, example.com is more precise
      then can go even further and go api.example.com.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something like .com or .gov is considered a top level domain (TLD), then a
      second level domain would be amazon.com
    </p>
    <p>
      Domain names must be registered with a registrar such as Amazon Route 53
      or GoDaddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      With your domain you have important DNS Records, these are A, AAAA, CNAME,
      NS.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Route 53 is a highly available, scalable, fully managed and authoritative
      DNS. Authoritative meaning the user can update the DNS records. Is the
      only service that provides 100% availability.
    </p>
    <p>Route 53 has the ability to check the health of your resources.</p>
    <p>Route 53 refers to the traditional DNS port being on 53.</p>
    <p>Your route 53 record defines how your route traffic for a domain:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Domain/subdomain Name - example.com</li>
      <li>RecordType - A, AAAA, cname</li>
      <li>Value - 123.4566.789.123</li>
      <li>Routing Policy - How route 53 responds to queries</li>
      <li>TTL - amount of time the record cached at DNS resolves</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Route 53 supports the following DNS record types: A, AAAA, CNAME, NS.</p>
    <p>These record types represent:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A - maps hostname to IPv4</li>
      <li>AAAA - maps hostname to IPv6</li>
      <li>
        <p>CNAME - maps hostname to another hostname</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Target is domain name which must an A or AAAA record</li>
          <li>
            Can't create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace
            (Zone Apex)
          </li>
          <li>
            Can't create a CNAME for example.com but can for www.example.com
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        NS - Name Servers for the hosted Zone, DNS names of IP addresses of
        servers that can respond to queries for hosted zone
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Hosted Zones</h3>
    <p>
      A container for records that define how to route traffic to a domain and
      its subdomains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Public hosted zones - contains records that specify how to route traffic
      on the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Private hosted zones - contain records that specify how you route traffic
      within one or more VPCs (internal corporate domains)
    </p>
    <p>$0.50 per month per hosted zone.</p>
    <p>$12 per domain per year.</p>

    />
    <h3>Records TTL (Time To Live)</h3>
    <p>
      The router 53 server must return a TTL alongside the IP address. This
      could be a low value such as 60 seconds or much higher such as 24 hours. A
      higher TTL saves money as the DNS server will get less requests from the
      clients but records will be outdated for longer.
    </p>
    <h3>CNAME vs Alias</h3>
    <h4>CNAME</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Points a hostname to any other hostname (app.mydomain.com to
        blabla.anything.com)
      </li>
      <li>Only for non root domain names</li>
      <li>
        Cannot be run against apex domain (such as example.com), only sub domain
        are allowed a CNAME (such as foo.example.com)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Alias</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Alias are specific to route 53</li>
      <li>Allows us to point a hostname to an AWS resource</li>
      <li>
        Works for root domain and non root domain (aka mydomain.com and
        example.mydomain.com)
      </li>
      <li>Free</li>
      <li>Health check</li>
      <li>Extension to DNS functionality</li>
      <li>Automatically recognize changes in the resource's IP address</li>
      <li>Alias record is always of type A or AAAA</li>
      <li>TTL cannot be set</li>
      <li>
        <p>Target can be</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Elastic load balancers</li>
          <li>CloudFront distributions</li>
          <li>API Gateway</li>
          <li>Elastic Beanstalk environments</li>
          <li>S3 Websites</li>
          <li>VPC interface endpoints</li>
          <li>Global accelerator</li>
          <li>Route 53 in the same hosted zone</li>
          <li>Cannot set an Alias record for an EC2 DNS name</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Routing Policies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Helps route 53 respond to DNS queries</li>
      <li>
        DNS is not routing traffic like how an ALB routes traffic to an EC2
        instance
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Routing policies</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Simple</li>
          <li>Weighted</li>
          <li>Failover</li>
          <li>Latency</li>
          <li>Geolocation</li>
          <li>Multi-value answer</li>
          <li>Geoproximity using route 53 traffic flow feature</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Simple</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Typically route traffic to a single resource</li>
      <li>Can specify multiple values in the same record</li>
      <li>
        If multiple values are returned a random one is chosen by the client
      </li>
      <li>When Alias enabled only one target can be specified</li>
      <li>Can not enable health checks</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Weighted</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Control which % of traffic gets sent to each record</li>
      <li>
        Weights don't need to sum up to 100, percentage calculated by specific
        route weight/total weight
      </li>
      <li>
        Use case, load balance between regions, testing new application versions
        with small amount of traffic, a/b testing
      </li>
      <li>
        0 would stop traffic being sent to a resource unless all resources have
        a weight of 0 at which point they share traffic equally
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Latency</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Redirect to the resource that has the lowest latency for us</li>
      <li>Helpful when users require low latency</li>
      <li>Latency is based on traffic between users and AWS regions</li>
      <li>
        Germany users could be directed to US if that has the lowest latency
      </li>
      <li>Can be associated with Health Checks (has a failover capability)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Health Checks</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Mainly for checking public resources</li>
      <li>
        If an instance is down we don't want to send users to the instance
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Halt Check => Automated DNS Failover:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Health checks that monitor an endpoint (application, server, other
            AWS resource)
          </li>
          <li>
            Health checks that monitor other health checked (calculated health
            checks)
          </li>
          <li>Health checks that monitor CloudWatch Alarms (full control)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Health check is every 30 seconds for regular, can pay for every 10
        seconds
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Monitoring the endpoint</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Around 15 health checkers running globally</li>
      <li>These use HTTP, HTTPS and TCP protocols</li>
      <li>
        If > 18% of health checkers report the endpoint as healthy then Route 53
        deems the endpoint healthy
      </li>
      <li>Health check passes if a status of 2xx or 3xx is returned</li>
      <li>
        Health check can be setup to pass/fail based on the text in the first
        5120 bytes of the response
      </li>
      <li>
        Configure router/firewall to allow incoming requests from Route 53
        health checkers
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Calculated health checks:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can combine multiple health checks into a single health check</li>
      <li>Can use AND, OR, NOT</li>
      <li>Can monitor upto 256 child health checks</li>
      <li>
        Specify how many of the health checks need to pass parent health check
      </li>
      <li>
        Usage: Updating website incrementally without causing all health checks
        to fail
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Health check on a private resource</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC</li>
      <li>Cannot access private endpoints</li>
      <li>
        Can created a CloudWatch metric and associate a CloudWatch Alarm, Health
        check checks for CloudWatch alarm
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Failover</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Require a primary instance that route 53 redirects to, instance which
        must have a health check
      </li>
      <li>
        Requires a second instance for route 53 to redirect to if primary
        instance health check is failing
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Geolocation</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Not same as US based</li>
      <li>Routing is based on user location</li>
      <li>Specify location by continent, country or by US state</li>
      <li>Should have a default record for if there is no location match</li>
      <li>
        Use case is for restricting content distribution based on users location
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Geoproximity</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Route traffic to your resources based on location of your users and the
        resources
      </li>
      <li>
        Ability to shift more traffic to resources based on the defined bias
      </li>
      <li>
        To change the size of the geographic region specify bias value (-99 to
        99)
      </li>
      <li>Higher number = more traffic to the resource</li>
      <li>
        Resources can be AWS resources (specify AWS region) or Non-AWS resources
        which require longitude and latitude
      </li>
      <li>Must enable route 53 traffic flow to enable the bias</li>
      <li>
        Really helpful when wanting to shift traffic from one region to another
        by increase/decreasing bias
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Traffic Flow</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Simplify the process of creating and maintaining records in large
        complex configurations
      </li>
      <li>Visual editor to mange complex routing decision trees</li>
      <li>
        <p>Configurations can be saved as Traffic Flow Policy</p>
        <ul>
          <li>supports versioning</li>
          <li>
            can be applied to different route 53 hosted zones (different domain
            names)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>IP Based</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Routing is based on clients' IP address</li>
      <li>
        You provide a list of CIDRs for your clients (CIDR is an IP range)
      </li>
      <li>For example can route specific ISP to a specific endpoint</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Multi Value</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Route traffic to multiple resources</li>
      <li>
        Can be associated with health checks so only healthy resources returned
      </li>
      <li>Up to 8 healthy records returned for each multi-value query</li>
      <li>
        Not a substitute for an ELB, client side chooses which resource to use
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Third Party Domains and Route 53</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Can buy domain from any registrar you want</li>
      <li>
        Domain registrar usually provides you with a DNS service to manage your
        DNS records
      </li>
      <li>You can use another DNS service to manage your DNS records</li>
      <li>
        For example purchase domain through GoDaddy but managed through Route53
      </li>
      <li>GoDaddy has to point at Route53 nameservers</li>
      <li>Create hosted zone in route 53</li>
      <li>Update NS records on 3rd party to point to Route53 Name Servers</li>
    </ul>
