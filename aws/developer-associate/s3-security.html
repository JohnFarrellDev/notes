    <h1>S3 Security</h1>

    <h2>Encryption</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>SSE-S3: Encrypts S3 objects using keys handled and managed by AWS</li>
      <li>
        SSE-KMS: Leverages AWS key management service to manage encryption keys
      </li>
      <li>SSE-C: manage your own encryption keys</li>
      <li>Client side encryption</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>SSE-S3</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Keys used to encrypt data are handled by S3</li>
      <li>Object is encrypted server side</li>
      <li>AES-256 encryption used</li>
      <li>Must set header: "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256"</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>SSE-KMS</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>SSE-KMS: encryption using keys handled and managed by KMS</li>
      <li>KMS advantages: user control + audit trail</li>
      <li>Object is encrypted server side</li>
      <li>Must set header: "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>SSE-C</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Server side encryption</li>
      <li>Amazon S3 does not store the key, you provide the key to AWS</li>
      <li>Must use HTTPS as submitting the encryption key in the request</li>
      <li>Keys stored client side</li>
      <li>Key must be provided when retrieving the files from S3</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Client Side Encryption</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Encrypt object before sending the object to S3</li>
      <li>Can utilize Amazon S3 Encryption Client</li>
      <li>Clients muse decrypt the key themselves when retrieving the data</li>
      <li>Customer fully manages the keys and encryption cycle</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>DSSE-KMS</strong>

    <p>
      By default all buckets use SSE-S3 but you can change this to a different
      encryption method. You can also set a bucket policy to refuse any API call
      with the wrong encryption headers.
    </p>

    <h2>S3 CORS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>CORS - Cross Origin Resource Sharing</li>
      <li>An origin is a scheme (protocol), a host (domain) and a port</li>
      <li>
        HTTP is the scheme, example.com is the domain, port is 443 for HTTPS and
        80 for HTTP
      </li>
      <li>
        Web browser based mechanism to allow request to other origins while
        visiting main origin
      </li>
      <li>
        URL can request resources from another URL if the other URL allows CORS
        using CORS Headers (access-control-allow-origin)
      </li>
      <li>
        If a client does a cross-origin request on our S3 bucket we need the
        correct CORS headers
      </li>
      <li>You can allow a specific origin or all using *</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>S3 MFA Delete</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        MFA forces user to generate a code on a device before doing important
        operations on S3
      </li>
      <li>
        Need MFA to delete an object version or suspend versioning on the bucket
      </li>
      <li>
        Do not need MFA for enabling versioning or listing deleted versions
      </li>
      <li>
        Only the bucket owner (root account) can enable/disable MFA-Delete
      </li>
      <li>MFA-Delete can only be enabled using the CLI</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>S3 Access Logs</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Any request to an S3 bucket automatically logs all requests into another
        bucket
      </li>
      <li>Data can be analyzed</li>
      <li>
        Never set your logging button to be your monitored bucket (creates an
        infinite logging loop)
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn on server access logging in AWS console and select a target bucket
      </li>
      <li>
        Permissions (ACL) are automatically enabled on logging bucket to allow
        monitor bucket to Write
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>S3 Pre-signed URLs</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Pre-signed URLS using SDK or CLI</li>
      <li>For downloads easier to use CLI</li>
      <li>For upload is harder and must use the SDK</li>
      <li>
        Valid for a default of 3600 seconds, can change timeout with
        --expires-in &lt;seconds&gt;
      </li>
      <li>
        Users given a pre-signed URL inherit the permissions of the person who
        generated the URL for GET/PUT
      </li>
      <li>
        Use case is to allow temporary permissions to interact with your bucket
        (GET or PUT)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>S3 Access Points</h2>
    <p>
      Works like a bucket policy but is applied to a bucket prefix such as
      /finance/. Can then allow our finance users to have read and write
      permissions for all objects found within the bucket within the finance
      prefix but not for data found within /sales/.
    </p>
    <p>Each access point has its own DNS name and an access point policy.</p>
    <p>
      We can define the access point to be accessible only from within a VPC so
      only our EC2 instance can access for example and not directly from the
      internet, you create a VPC endpoint to access the Access Point.
    </p>

    <h2>S3 Object Lambda</h2>
    <p>
      Can use AWS Lambda Functions to change the object before it is retrieved
      by the caller application. Only one bucket is needed on top of which we
      create our S3 Access Point and S3 Object Lambda Access Points but the
      caller retrieves different data.

    <p>
      Use cases are to often transform data, watermark an image or redact PII.
