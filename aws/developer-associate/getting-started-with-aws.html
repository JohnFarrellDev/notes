    <h1>Getting Started With AWS</h1>

    <p>
      AWS launched when Amazon realized they had all this technical skill and
      extra computing power and they could offer this as a service to other
      companies. Over the years this has continuously expanded into the huge
      offerings now supported by AWS and their services being utilized by almost
      every large company.
    </p>

    />

    <p>
      In 2019 AWS had $35 billion in revenue and accounted for 47% of the cloud
      market. There are over 1,000,000 active users on AWS.
    </p>

    <p>
      AWS enables people to build sophisticated scalable applications. The uses
      apply to a diverse set of industries such as enterprise IT, data storage
      and back up, big data analytics, website hosting, mobile apps and so on.
    </p>

    <h2>AWS Global Infrastructure</h2>

    <p>
      AWS is a global service with servers hosted all around the world, this
      global service is made of of Regions, Availability Zones, Data Centers,
      Edge Locations and Points of Presence.

    >

    <p>
      We can see that in a continent such as America there are multiple regions
      such as us-east-1, us-east-2, us-east-3. Within each region there are
      multiple Availability Zones too.
    </p>

    <h3>Regions and Availability Zones</h3>

    <p>
      Most services are region scoped (excluding IAM, Route 53, CloudFront,
      WAF).
    </p>

    <p>
      Choosing which region to launch an application can depend on multiple
      factors:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Compliance with data governance laws</li>
      <li>Proximity to customers to reduce</li>
      <li>latency</li>
      <li>Now all regions contain every service</li>
      <li>Pricing can vary between regions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Regions consist of AZs. Most regions have 3 AZs, the lowest is 2 and the
      max is 6. Availability zones are a cluster of logical data centres.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each availability zone has independent power, cooling and physical
      security and is connected via redundant, ultra-low latency networks. The
      AZs are isolated so one AZ going down should not impact the other AZs. By
      deploying to multiple AZs services will have greater fault tolerance. AZs
      belonging in the same region are interconnected with high-bandwidth,
      low-latency networking. Traffic between AZs is encrypted. The network
      performance is sufficient to accomplish synchronous replication between
      AZs. Within the AZ there can be multiple data centres each with their own
      redundant power, networking and connectivity.
    </p>

    <h3>Edge Locations - AWS Points of Presence</h3>

    <p>
      AWS currently have over 400 points of presence, 400+ edge locations + 10
      regional caches in over 90 cities over 40+ countries.
    </p>
    <p>This allows content delivery with ultra low latency.</p>

  <h3>Global services vs Regional Services</h3>

  <p>
    Most services that AWS offer are based in regions, some services for example
    are not available in all regions. For example EC2 is a region based service,
    if in eu-west-2 you create an EC2 user data for bootstrapping your image you
    will not see the bootstrapped image in eu-west-1.
  </p>

  <p>A few services are global however.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</li>
    <li>Route 53 (DNS Service)</li>
    <li>CloudFront (CDN)</li>
    <li>WAF (Web Application Firewall)</li>
  </ul>
