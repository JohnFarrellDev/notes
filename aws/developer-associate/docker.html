    <h1>ECS, ECR and Fargate</h1>

    <h2>What is Docker</h2>
    <p>
      A software platform for deploying apps, Docker packages applications in
      containers that can run on any OS. This ensures that applications can run
      on any machine without compatibility issues, making them predictable, easy
      to maintain, and deploy. Images are stored in Docker repositories such as
      hub.docker.com (public) or Amazon ECR (private - Elastic Container
      Registry). Docker is similar to virtualization, but resources can be
      shared across multiple containers.
    </p>

    <p>To manage containers, a container management platform is needed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ECS: Amazon's platform</li>
      <li>Fargate: Amazon's serverless platform</li>
      <li>EKS: Amazon's managed Kubernetes platform</li>
    </ul>

    <img
      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/docker-image-pipeline.png"
    />

    <p>AWS docker services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Elastic Container Service (ECS)</li>
      <li>Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)</li>
      <li>Fargate (serverless container platform)</li>
      <li>Elastic Container Registry (ECR) - store container images</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ECS Clusters</h2>
    <p>
      ECS Clusters are logical groupings of EC2 instances. EC2 instances run the
      ECS agent (a Docker container), which registers the instance to the ECS
      cluster. These EC2 instances use a special AMI made for ECS.
    </p>

    <h2>Amazon ECS</h2>
    <h3>AWS ECS - EC2 Launch Type</h3>
    <p>
      Launch Docker containers on AWS which is launching ECS Tasks on ECS
      Clusters.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the EC2 launch type your must provision and maintain the EC2
      infrastructure, each EC2 instance must run the ECS agent to register as
      part of the ECS cluster.
    </p>
    <p>AWS then takes care of starting and stopping the containers.</p>
    <img
      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ecs-ec2-launch-type.png"
    />

    <h3>Fargate Launch Type</h3>
    <p>
      Do not need to provision the infrastructure as Fargate is serverless, you
      just create task definitions and AWS manage the infrastructure for you.
    </p>

    <h3>IAM Roles for ECS</h3>
    <p>
      The EC2 instance profile is used by the ECS agent to make API calls to the
      ECS service, send container logs to CloudWatch Logs, and pull Docker
      images from ECR.
    </p>
    <p>
      An ECS task role allows each task to have a specific role, enabling the
      use of different roles for the various ECS services you run. Task role is
      defined in the task definition.
    </p>

    <h3>Load Balancer Integrations</h3>
    <p>
      An ALB can be put in front of our ECS cluster to expose our tasks via an
      HTTPS endpoint and then forwarded to the ECS Task.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NLB is only recommended for high throughput or performance use cases
      or to pair with an AWS Private Link.
    </p>
    <p>
      The classic load balancer is not recommended and does not integrate with
      Fargate.
    </p>

    <h3>ECS Data Volumes</h3>
    <strong>EFS</strong>
    <p>
      Mount EFS file systems onto ECS tasks, works for both EC2 land Fargate
      launch types.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tasks running an any AZ will share the same data in the EFS file system.
    </p>
    <p>Fargate + EFS = complexly serverless stack</p>
    <img
      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ecs-with-efs.png"
    />
    <p>S3 cannot be mounted as a file system!</p>
    <strong>EBS Volumes</strong>
    <p>
      The volume is already mounted onto the EC2 instance, allowing your Docker
      containers to mount the EBS volume and extend the storage capacity of your
      task. However, if your task moves from one instance to another, it won't
      have access to the same EBS volume. A common use case is to mount a data
      volume between different containers on the same instance, extending the
      temporary storage of a task.
    </p>
    <strong>Bind Mounts</strong>
    <p>
      This setup works for both EC2 tasks (using local instance storage - tied
      to the life of the instance) and Fargate tasks (which get 20-200 GiB for
      volume mounts). It is used to share ephemeral storage between multiple
      containers that are part of the same ECS task. This approach is great for
      the "sidecar" container pattern, such as for handling logs, providing a
      clear separation of concerns.
    </p>

    <h2>ECS Auto Scaling</h2>
    <p>
      ECS Auto Scaling scales using AWS Application Auto Scaling. Can scale on
      Average CPU utilization, Average Memory Utilization, ALB Request Counts
      Per target.
    </p>
    <p>
      ECS Auto Scaling tracks CPU and RAM usage in CloudWatch at the ECS service
      level. It supports three scaling methods: Target Tracking, which targets a
      specific average CloudWatch metric; Step Scaling, which scales based on
      CloudWatch alarms; and Scheduled Scaling, which scales based on
      predictable changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      ECS server scaling (task level) differs from EC2 auto scaling (instance
      level). Fargate auto scaling is much easier to set up due to its
      serverless nature. To scale ECS and EC2 simultaneously, use a cluster
      capacity provider.
    </p>
    <p>
      A capacity provider is used with a cluster to determine the infrastructure
      that a task runs on. For ECS and Fargate users, the Fargate and
      Fargate_Spot capacity providers are automatically added. For ECS on EC2,
      you need to associate the capacity provider with an auto scaling group,
      allowing the capacity provider to provision instances for the ASG.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can setup your own ASG to spin up more EC2s based on various metrics
      but it is preferred to use a capacity provider as it syncs the instances
      and tasks better.
    </p>

    <h2>ECS Rolling Update</h2>
    <p>
      When updating a deployed version we can define a minimum healthy
      percentage and maximum percentage of our tasks within our cluster.
    </p>
    <p>
      If our minimum healthy percentage is 100% and our maximum percentage is
      125% then to update all our tasks from v1 to v2 would take 4 steps of
      terminating 25% of our old tasks and replacing them with the new tasks.
    </p>
    <p>The advantage of this is to avoid any downtime.</p>
    <img
      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ecs-rolling-update.png"
    />

    <h2>ECS Task Definitions</h2>
    <p>
      ECS Task Definitions are metadata in JSON format that tell ECS how to run
      a Docker container. They contain information about:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Image name</li>
      <li>Port binding for container and host</li>
      <li>Memory and CPU required</li>
      <li>Environment variables</li>
      <li>Networking information</li>
      <li>IAM Role</li>
      <li>Logging configuration (CloudWatch for example)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Can define upto 10 containers in a task definition.</p>
    <h3>Load Balancing (EC2 Launch Type)</h3>
    <p>
      We get a Dynamic Host Port Mapping if you only define the container port
      in the task definition.
    </p>
    <img
      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ecs-dynamic-port-mapping.png"
    />
    <p>The ALB automatically finds the correct port to connect to.</p>
    <p>
      You must allow on the EC2 instance's security group any port from the ALB
      security group.
    </p>
    <h3>Load Balancing (Fargate Launch Type)</h3>
    <p>Each task has a unique private IP.</p>
    <p>Only define the container port, host port is not applicable.</p>
    <p>
      Each ECS task is connected to an ENI which the ALB connects to, the ENI
      must allow the connection on specific ports from the ALB.
    </p>
    <img
      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ecs-load-balancing-fargate.png"
    />
    <h3>IAM Roles</h3>
    <p>There is one IAM role per Task Definition.</p>
    <p>
      Each ECS task created by the definition inherits the role, the role is
      defined at the task level not the service level!.
    </p>
    <h3>Environment Variables</h3>
    <p>
      Can be hardcoded if they are not sensitive such as URLs. If they are
      sensitive can utilise SSM Parameter store or Secrets Manager, from the ECS
      task definition you reference the parameter store or secrets manager which
      then allows the values to be fetched at run times. The values can also be
      bulk loaded from S3 at runtime.
    </p>

    <h2>EC2 Task Placement</h2>
    <p>
      ECS Task Placement and Constraints determine how and where tasks are
      placed on EC2 instances. When launching (or removing) a task of type EC2,
      ECS must determine placement within the constraints of CPU, memory, and
      available ports. When a service scales down, ECS needs to decide which
      task to terminate. To assist with this, you can define a task placement
      strategy and task placement constraints. This applies only to ECS with
      EC2.
    </p>
    <p>Task placement strategies are a best effort:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Identify the instances that satisfy the CPU, memory, and port
        requirements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Identify the instances that satisfy the task placement constraints.
      </li>
      <li>
        Identify the instances that satisfy the task placement strategies.
      </li>
      <li>Select the instances for task placement.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Task Placement Strategies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Binpack:</strong> Places tasks based on the least available
        amount of CPU or memory, minimizing the number of instances in use to
        save money. It will place as many containers as possible on one instance
        before creating a new instance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Random:</strong> Places tasks randomly across selected
        instances.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spread:</strong> Places tasks evenly based on a specified value
        such as availability zones, which is good for availability.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can mix task placement strategies, for example, spread on AZ and then
      use binpack.
    </p>
    <h3>Task Placement Constraints</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>distinctInstance:</strong> Places each task on a different
        container instance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>memberOf:</strong> Places tasks on instances that satisfy an
        expression using the cluster query language, such as placing containers
        only on t2.micro instances.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Amazon ECR</h2>
    <p>
      ECR (Elastic Container Registry) is a Docker image repository for private
      and public images. Access is controlled through IAM (permission errors are
      typically due to policy issues).
    </p>
    <p>ECR is fully integrated with ECS and backed by S3.</p>
    <p>
      ECR supports image vulnerability scanning, versioning, image tags, image
      lifecycle...
    </p>
    <p>AWS CLI login commands may be asked in the exam:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        AWS CLI v1 login command: Run the output of
        <code
          >aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region &lt;region&gt;</code
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        AWS CLI v2 login command uses pipes:
        <code
          >aws ecr get-login-password --region &lt;region&gt; | docker login
          --username AWS --password-stdin
          1234567890.dkr.ecr.&lt;region&gt;.amazonaws.com</code
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Common Docker commands for ECR:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Docker push:
        <code
          >docker push
          1234567890.dkr.&lt;region&gt;.amazonaws.com/demo:latest</code
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Docker pull:
        <code
          >docker pull
          1234567890.dkr.&lt;region&gt;.amazonaws.com/demo:latest</code
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Services require IAM permissions to pull from ECR if building images from
      ECR.
    </p>

    />

    <h2>AWS Copilot</h2>
    <p>
      CLI (or YAML file) tool to build, release and operate production-ready
      containerized apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Run your apps using AppRunner, ECS and Fargate. The aim is to help you
      focus on building the app and not infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Automatically provisions all required infrastructure for your
      containerized apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gives you access to automated deployments with one command using
      CodePipeline.
    </p>
    <img
      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-copilot.png"
    />

    <h2>AWS EKS</h2>
    <p>
      EKS stands for Elastic Kubernetes Service, it is a way to launch a managed
      Kubernetes cluster on AWS.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an alternative to ECS but gives us a way to launch containers on
      AWS. Kubernetes is open source, it has a similar goal to ECS but has a
      different API.
    </p>
    <p>
      EKS supports EC2 if you want to deploy worker nodes or Fargate mode to
      deploy serverless clusters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The use case for EKS is if you already use Kubernetes at your company or
      prefer the API.
    </p>

    />
    <h3>Node Types</h3>
    <strong>Managed Node Groups</strong>
    <p>
      Create and manage Nodes for you, nodes are part of an ASG managed by EKS.
      Supports On-Demand or Spot Instances.
    </p>
    <strong>Self-Managed Nodes</strong>
    <p>
      Nodes created by you and registered to the EKS cluster and managed by an
      ASG.
    </p>
    <p>Can still use the prebuilt AMI that is optimized for EKS.</p>
    <strong>Fargate</strong>
    <p>No maintenance required, no nodes managed.</p>
    <h3>Data Volumes</h3>
    <p>
      Need to specify StorageClass manifest on your EKS cluster, leverages a
      COntainer Storage INterface compliant driver, support for EBS, EFS (with
      Fargate), FSx for Lustre, FSx for NetApp ONTAP.
