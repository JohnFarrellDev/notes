    <h1>Elastic Beanstalk</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Most web apps have the same architecture, typically using an ALB and ASG.
      Developers want a single way or place to deploy applications. Beanstalk
      handles EC2, ASG, ELB, and RDS as managed services. Developers are only
      responsible for the application code, while still having control over the
      configuration. Beanstalk itself is free, but you still pay for the
      underlying infrastructure. Behind the scenes CloudFormation is creating
      all the infrastructure required by EBS.
    </p>

    <h3>Beanstalk Components</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Application:</strong> A collection of Elastic Beanstalk
      components, including environments, versions, and configurations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Application versions:</strong> An iteration of your application
      code.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Environment:</strong> A collection of AWS resources running an
      application version (only one version at a time).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tiers: Web server environment tier, worker environment tier.</li>
      <li>You can have multiple environments (e.g., dev, test, prod).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Elastic Beanstalk (EBS) supports Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python,
      Ruby, and Docker. You can also write your own custom platform.
    </p>
    <h3>Web Server vs Worker Environment</h3>
    <p>
      If performing long-running tasks, offload them to a dedicated worker
      environment which can process tasks from a queue. Decoupling your
      application into tiers is common. Examples include processing a video or
      generating a zip file. You can define periodic tasks in a file called
      cron.yaml.

    <h3>Deployment Modes</h3>
    <strong>Single Instance:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Great for dev</li>
      <li>DNS name points to an Elastic IP</li>
      <li>Single instance in a single AZ</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>High Availability with Load Balancer:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Great for prod</li>
      <li>DNS name points to an ELB DNS name</li>
      <li>Multiple instances across multiple AZs</li>
    </ul>

    />

    <h2>Deployment Options</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>All at once:</strong> Deploy all in one go, fastest but
        instances are not available to serve for a small amount of time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rolling:</strong> Update a few instances (bucket) at a time,
        then move onto the next bucket when the previous bucket is healthy. No
        downtime, no extra cost, potentially long deployment, and runs below
        capacity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rolling with additional batches:</strong> Similar to rolling but
        spins up new instances to move the batch. The old application is still
        available, can run at full capacity, small cost, longer deployment, good
        for production.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Immutable:</strong> Spins up new instances in a new ASG, deploys
        the version to these instances, and then swaps all the instances when
        everything is healthy. Swaps out the whole ASG, highest cost, longest
        deployment, potential for quick rollback, and great for production.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Blue Green:</strong> Create a new environment and switch over
        when ready.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Traffic Splitting:</strong> canary testing - send a small % of
        traffic to the new deployment.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>All at Once</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Fastest deployment</li>
      <li>Application has downtime</li>
      <li>Great for quick iterations in a dev environment</li>
      <li>No additional cost</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Rolling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Application will run below capacity while some instances are switched
      </li>
      <li>
        Can set the bucket size to determine how many instances are switched at
        a time
      </li>
      <li>No additional cost</li>
      <li>
        Long deployment (imagine 100s of instances with a bucket size of 2)
      </li>
      <li>Both versions of application run simultaneously</li>
    </ul>

      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebs-rolling-deployment.png"
    />
    <h3>Rolling with Additional Batches</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Application continues to run at capacity</li>
      <li>Can set the bucket size</li>
      <li>Both versions of the application run simultaneously</li>
      <li>Small additional cost</li>
      <li>Additional batch is removed at the end of deployment</li>
      <li>Longer deployment</li>
      <li>Good for production</li>
    </ul>
    <img
      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebs-rolling-additional-batches.png"
    />
    <h3>Immutable</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Zero downtime</li>
      <li>New code deployed to new instances on a temporary ASG</li>
      <li>High cost as capacity is doubled</li>
      <li>Longest deployment</li>
      <li>
        Bonus is a quick rollback in case of failure, just terminate the new ASG
      </li>
      <li>Good for prod</li>
    </ul>
    <img
      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebs-immutable.png"
    />
    <h3>Traffic Splitting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Canary testing</li>
      <li>New application version is deployed to a temporary ASG</li>
      <li>
        A small percentage of traffic is sent to the new ASG for a configurable
        amount of time
      </li>
      <li>Deployment health is monitored</li>
      <li>
        If there is a deployment failure, this triggers an automated rollback
      </li>
      <li>
        If everything works fine, new instances are migrated from the temporary
        ASG to the new ASG
      </li>
      <li>No downtime</li>
    </ul>
    <img
      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ebs-traffic-splitting.png"
    />
    <h3>Blue/Green Deployment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Not a <strong>direct feature</strong>of EBS</li>
      <li>Zero downtime and release facility</li>
      <li>
        Create a new EBS "stage" environment and deploy the new code version
        there
      </li>
      <li>New environment can be validated independently</li>
      <li>
        Use Route 53 with a weighted policy to send some traffic to the new
        version
      </li>
      <li>When fully satisfied, swap URLs in Beanstalk</li>
      <li>Manual process that is not directly embedded into EBS</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Elastic Beanstalk CLI</h2>
    <p>
      Elastic Beanstalk provides an additional CLI called the EB CLI
      specifically for working with Beanstalk from the command line. Helpful
      commands (not required for the exam) include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>eb create</li>
      <li>eb status</li>
      <li>eb health</li>
      <li>eb events</li>
      <li>eb logs</li>
      <li>eb open</li>
      <li>eb deploy</li>
      <li>eb config</li>
      <li>eb terminate</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This CLI is helpful for automated deployment pipelines.</p>
    <p>
      To use Elastic Beanstalk, you need to describe dependencies such as in
      <code>package.json</code> for Node.js and package your code as a zip file.
      To create a new version, simply upload the zip file. Elastic Beanstalk
      will deploy the zip on each EC2 instance, resolve dependencies, and start
      the application.
    </p>

    <h2>Elastic Beanstalk Lifecycle Policy</h2>
    <p>
      You can store up to 1000 application versions in Elastic Beanstalk. After
      reaching this limit, you must remove old versions. You can phase out old
      versions with a lifecycle policy. The policy can be based on time
      (removing versions after a certain time) or space (removing the oldest
      version when hitting a maximum number of versions threshold set by the
      user). Versions currently in use won't be deleted. There's also an option
      to not delete the source bundle in S3 to prevent data loss.
    </p>

    <h2>Beanstalk Extensions</h2>
    <p>
      We upload a zip file with our code to EBS. All the parameters set in the
      UI can be configured with code using files. Requirements include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Files must be in the <code>.ebextensions</code> directory in the root of
        the source code
      </li>
      <li>Files should be in YAML/JSON format</li>
      <li>
        Files must have <code>.config</code> extensions (e.g.,
        <code>logging.config</code>)
      </li>
      <li>
        Ability to modify some default settings using
        <code>option_settings</code>
      </li>
      <li>Ability to add resources such as RDS, ElastiCache, and DynamoDB</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Resources managed by <code>.ebextensions</code> are deleted if the
      environment goes away.
    </p>

    <h2>Elastic Beanstalk and CloudFormation</h2>
    <p>
      Under the hood, Beanstalk relies on CloudFormation. CloudFormation is used
      to provision other AWS services. This means you can provision any other
      AWS service from the <code>.ebextensions</code> directory by hooking into
      CloudFormation, even if it's not shown in the AWS console UI.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can define CloudFormation resources in your .ebextensions to provision
      ElastiCache, an S3 bucket or anything else.
    </p>

    <h2>Beanstalk Cloning</h2>
    <p>
      You can clone an existing environment to a new environment with the same
      configuration. This is useful for deploying a test version of your
      application that has the same configuration as production. Note that data
      would not be preserved, only the RDS configuration.
    </p>

    <h2>Beanstalk Migrations</h2>
    <h3>Load Balancer</h3>
    <p>After creating an ELB, you cannot change the ELB type. To migrate:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Create a new environment with the same configuration except for the load
        balancer (can't clone because it will clone the load balancer).
      </li>
      <li>Deploy your application to the new environment.</li>
      <li>Perform a CNAME swap or re-route Route 53 traffic.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>RDS</h3>
    <p>
      RDS can be provisioned by EBS, which is great for dev/test environments.
      However, it's not ideal for production as the database lifecycle is tied
      to the EBS environment. The best practice for production is to separately
      create an RDS database and provide your EB application with the connection
      string.
    </p>
    <p><strong>To decouple RDS:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a snapshot of the RDS database as a safeguard.</li>
      <li>Go to the RDS console and protect the database from deletion.</li>
      <li>
        Create a new EBS environment without RDS and point the application to
        the existing RDS.
      </li>
      <li>Perform a CNAME swap or Route 53 update and confirm it's working.</li>
      <li>Terminate the old environment (the RDS won't be deleted).</li>
      <li>Delete the CloudFormation stack in DELETE_FAILED state.</li>
    </ul>
