    <h1>S3 Introduction</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>One of main building blocks of AWS</li>
      <li>Infinitely scaling storage</li>
      <li>Widely popular</li>
      <li>Many websites use S3 as a backbone, can deploy sites to S3</li>
      <li>Many other AWS services integrate with S3</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Buckets</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        S3 allows people to store objects (files) in buckets (directories)
      </li>
      <li>Buckets must have a globally unique name</li>
      <li>Buckets are defined at the region level</li>
      <li>
        Naming convention is no uppercase and no underscore, 3-64 characters
        long, no IP, start with letter or number
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Paths</h2>
    <p>Files have a key, the key is the full path to the file.</p>
    <p>s3://my-bucket/my_folder/another_folder/my_file.txt</p>
    <p>
      Key is composed of a prefix and object name, prefix is
      /my_folder/another_folder and object name is my_file.txt
    </p>
    <p>Full key is /my_folder/another_folder/my_file.txt</p>
    <p>
      There's no concept of directories within buckets, the full path is just
      the key though the UI will make it look like directories exist
    </p>

    <p>S3 has many use cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Backup and storage</li>
      <li>Disaster recovery</li>
      <li>Archive</li>
      <li>Hybrid cloud storage</li>
      <li>Application hosting</li>
      <li>Media hosting</li>
      <li>Data lakes and big data analytics</li>
      <li>Software delivery</li>
      <li>Static websites</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Files</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Maximum object size on S3 is 5 Tb</li>
      <li>If uploading more than 5GB must use multi-part upload</li>
      <li>
        Each object on S3 can have metadata (key: value pair) and also up to 10
        tags which is useful for security/life-cycle
      </li>
      <li>Objects also have versioning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Versioning</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can version files in S3</li>
      <li>It is enabled at the bucket level</li>
      <li>
        Same key will overwrite existing file with a new version, incrementing
        integers starting at 1
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Best practice to version your buckets</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Protection against unintended deletes of a file (object still in S3
            but will just have a new version with a Delete marker)
          </li>
          <li>
            If you want to permanently delete you can select specific versions
            to delete
          </li>
          <li>Can rollback to to previous versions</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Any file before versioning provisioned has null version</li>
      <li>
        If you suspend versioning on a bucket the pre-existing versions on files
        will persist
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      Security can be user based such as IAM policies, which API calls should be
      allowed for a specific user from IAM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Security can also be resource based such as bucket policies, these are
      bucket wide rules that can be set. There are also object access control
      list filters which provide a finer grain of filtering. Also bucket ACL
      which is less common.
    </p>
    <p>
      An IAM principal can access an S3 object if the user IAM permissions allow
      it OR the resource policy allows it AND there's no explicit deny.
    </p>

    <h3>Policies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Policies are JSON based</li>
      <li>Applied to buckets or objects</li>
      <li>Effect is allow or deny</li>
      <li>Action set of APIs to allow or deny</li>
      <li>Principal is the account or user to apply the policy too</li>
      <li>Use S3 bucket policy to make the bucket publicly accessible</li>
      <li>
        Force object to be encrypted at upload, policy deny any API PUT unless
        x-amz-server-side-encryption is not null and has value AES256
      </li>
      <li>Grant access to another account</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Bucket Settings for Blocking Public Access</strong>
    <p>Block public access to buckets and their objects using:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>New access control lists</li>
      <li>Any access control lists</li>
      <li>New public buckets or access point policies</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Other</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Supports VPC endpoints for instances in VPC without WWW internet</li>
      <li>
        <p>Logging and audit:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>S3 access logs can be stored in other S3 buckets</li>
          <li>API calls can be logged in AWS CloudTrail</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>User Security:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            MFA Delete: MFA required to delete objects/versions of objects
          </li>
          <li>
            Pre-signed URLS: Only valid for a limited time (use-case, download
            premium video for logged in users, limited time access for users)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>S3 Website</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the WWW</li>
      <li>S3 bucket must allow public access if hosting static websites (only need to require GET and we can select for only specific files to be publicly accessible)</li>
      <li>The website url will be the <bucket-name>.s3-website-<aws-region>.amazonaws.com</li>
    </ul>
  </body>

  <h2>S3 Consistency Model</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Strongly consistent as of December 2020</li>
    <li>After a successful write (PUT) or an overwrite (PUT or DELETE) and subsequent read request immediately receives the latest version of the object</li>
    <li>Read after write consistency</li>
    <li>Subsequent list request immediately reflects changes (list consistency)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Storage Classes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Standard - General Purpose</li>
    <li>Standard-Infrequent Access</li>
    <li>One Zone-Infrequent Access</li>

  </ul>
  <p>Can move object manually between classes or can be automated.</p>
  <p>Amazon has very high durability at 11 9s, same for all storage classes.</p>
  <h3>S3 Standard</h3>
  <p>S3 standard has 99.99% availability. Used for frequently accessed data. Low latency and high throughput. Sustain 2 concurrent facility failures. Use cases are big data analytics, mobile and gaming applications and content distribution.</p>
  <h3>Infrequent Access</h3>
  <p>For data that is infrequently accessed but the latency must be low when retrieved. Costs less than S3 standard.</p>
  <p>99.9% availability, use case is DR and backups.</p>
  <strong>One-Zone Infrequent Access</strong>
  <p>Very high durability at 11 9s but only 99.5% availability.</p>
  <p>Use case is storing secondary backups of on premise data or data that can be recreated.</p>
  <h3>Glacier Storage Classes</h3>
  <p>Low cost object storage meant for archiving and backup.</p>
  <p>Pricing is for storage and object retrieval cost.</p>
  <strong>Instant Retrieval</strong>
  <p>Millisecond retrieval, great for quarterly accessed data.</p>
  <p>Minimum storage duration of 90 days.</p>
  <strong>Glacier Flexible Retrieval</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Expedited - 1 to 5 minutes</li>
    <li>Standard - 3 to 5 hours</li>
    <li>Bulk - 5 to 12 hours</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Minimum storage duration of 90 days.</p>
  <h3>Glacier Deep archive</h3>
  <p>Standard - 12 hours</p>
  <p>Bulk - 48 hours</p>
  <p>Cheapest price</p>
  <h3>Intelligent-Tiering</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Small monty monitoring and auto-tiering fees</li>
    <li>Moves objects automatically across access tiers based on usage</li>
    <li>No retrieval charges in Intelligent-Tiering</li>
  </ul>
