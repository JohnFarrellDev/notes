    <h1>Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling Groups</h1>

    <h2>Scalability and High Availability</h2>
    <p>
      Scalability means that an application can handle greater loads by adapting
      to the current requirements.
    </p>
    <p>Scalability is linked but different from availability.</p>
    <p>
      Two types of scalability exist, horizontal (also called elasticity) and
      vertical. Vertical scalability means increasing the size/performance of
      the instance, go from t2.micro to t2.large EC2 instance. Vertical
      scalability is common for non distributed systems such as a database, RDS,
      elasticache. Horizontal scalability means increasing the number of
      instances for your application, this could mean adding more instances.
      This implies a distributed system, it is common for web applications and
      modern applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horizontal scaling when creating new instances is called scaling out,
      reducing instances is called scaling in.
    </p>
    <p>Auto scaling groups are multi AZ, load balances are multi AZ.</p>
    <p>
      Horizontal scaling can increase our availability, by ensuring our
      instances our in different AZs if one AZ goes down our service can
      continue running.
    </p>

    <h2>Load Balancing</h2>
    <p>
      A load balancer is a server/s that forwards traffic to downstream servers,
      spreads load across multiple downstream instances and exposes a single DNS
      to your application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Allows for failures of downstream instances to be seamlessly handled. The
      load balancer will do regular health-check of your downstream instances.
    </p>
    <p>Load balancers will provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for our websites.</p>
    <p>Load balancers can enforce stickiness using cookies.</p>
    <p>Load balancers provide high availability across available zones.</p>
    <p>
      Load balancers allow us to separate public traffic from private traffic.
    </p>
    <p>An ELB is a managed load balancer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>AWS guarantees that it works</li>
      <li>AWS maintains upgrades</li>
      <li>AWS provides a few configuration options</li>
      <li>Costs less and is less effort</li>
      <li>
        Integrates with other AWS services such as - EC2, Auto Scaling Groups,
        ECS, AWS Certificate Manager, CloudWatch, Route 53, AWS WAF
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Health Checks</h3>
    <p>
      Health checks are a way to determine if an EC2 instance is working
      correctly, this enables load balancers to know if they should forward
      traffic to the service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Health check is done by calling a port and a route, typically /health, if
      the response is not 200 then the application is not working properly.
    </p>

    <h3>Types of Load Balancers on AWS</h3>
    <p>AWS has 4 kinds of managed load balancers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Classic load balancer (v1 - old generation) - 2009, handles HTTP, HTTPS,
        TCP, SSL. Has been deprecated by AWS.
      </li>
      <li>
        Application load balancer (v2 - new generation) - 2016, handles HTTP,
        HTTPS, WebSocket
      </li>
      <li>
        Network load balancer (v2 - new generation) - 2017, handles TCP, TLS,
        UDP
      </li>
      <li>
        Gateway load balancer - 2020, operates at layer 3, network layer, IP
        protocol, won't be required in this section
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Some load balancers can be setup as internal (private IP) or external
      (public facing IP)
    </p>

    <h3>Load Balancer Security Group</h3>
    <p>
      A public facing load balancer is going to be interacted with by the
      internet so must allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic from anywhere. The
      downstream EC2 instance can then only allow inbound traffic from the load
      balancer so is not directly accessible by the public.
    </p>

    <h3>Application Load Balancer (v2)</h3>
    <p>
      The Application load balancing supports HTTP/HTTPS (Layer 7). Can load
      balance to multiple applications on the same machine (e.g containers). The
      ALB has support for HTTP/2, HTTPS and WebSockets and it cna redirect HTTP
      requests to HTTPS.
    </p>
    <p>
      It sorts rule based routing tables to different target groups, for
      example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can route based on path in url for example /users vs /posts</li>
      <li>
        Can route based on hostname in URL one.example.com vs two.example.com
      </li>
      <li>Can route based on query string headers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As a result are a great fit for micro services and container based
      applications. Has a port mapping feature to redirect a dynamic port in ECS
      (elastic container service).
    </p>
    <p>
      The classic load balancer can only handle one application, application
      load balancer can have many applications.
    </p>
    <p>The target group for an ALB can be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>EC2 instances (can be managed by an ASG) - HTTP</li>
      <li>ECS instances (managed by ECS) - HTTP</li>
      <li>Lambda functions - HTTP request is translated to a JSON event</li>
      <li>IP addresses (must be private IPS)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The ALB can route to multiple target groups, health checks are done at the
      target group level.
    </p>
    <p>With an ALB you can get a fixed hostname.</p>
    <p>
      As the request to the application is forward through a load balancer they
      don't see the client's IP directly, the true IP of the client is inserted
      into the X-Forwarded-For header, there is also X-Forwarded-Port and
      X-Forwarded-Proto.
    </p>

    <h3>Network Load Balancer (v2)</h3>
    <p>
      The NLB has really high performance, can handle millions of requests per
      second with latency of around 100ms compared to 400ms for the ALB.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NLB allows the forwarding of TCP and UDP traffic (layer 4). The NLB
      only has one static IP per AZ which can be helpful for whitelisting one
      specific IP. IP can be assigned using Elastic IP.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typical used when extreme performance is required when dealing with TCP or
      UDP traffic.
    </p>
    <p>Target groups can be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>EC2 instances</li>
      <li>Private IP addresses</li>
      <li>
        ALB - used for getting fixed IP address but then ALB has rules around
        handling the HTTP request such as path name routing.
      </li>
      <li>Health check supports the TCP, HTTP and HTTPS protocols.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Gateway Load Balancer</h3>
    <p>
      To deploy, scale and manage a fleet of 3rd party network virtual
      appliances in AWS. If you want all traffic in your network to go through
      some firewall intrusion, packet inspection etc.
    </p>
    <p>Operates at layer 3 (network layer) - IP packets.</p>
    <p>The GWLB combines the following functions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Transparent network gateway - single entry/exit for all traffic</li>
      <li>Load balancer - distribute traffic to your virtual appliances</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The GWL uses the GENEVE protocol on port 6081.</p>
    <p>Target groups are EC2 instances or private IPs.</p>

    />

    <h2>Sticky Sessions (Session Affinity)</h2>
    <p>
      It is possible to make sessions sticky, the same client to the load
      balancer gets redirected to the same instance each time, works for the
      CLB, ALB and NLB.
    </p>
    <p>Implemented using a cookie set by the developer.</p>
    <p>
      Allows the user to maintain their session data by being connected to the
      same backend instance.
    </p>
    <p>Can create an imbalanced load on our backend instances though.</p>
    <p>There are two types of cookies, application or duration:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Application-based cookie:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a custom cookie</li>
          <li>Generated by the target</li>
          <li>Can include any custom attributes required by the application</li>
          <li>
            Cookie name must be specified individually for each target group
          </li>
          <li>
            Cannot use AWSALB, AWSALBAPP or AWSALBTG as these are already
            reserved by ELB
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Application cookie:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Generated by the load balancer</li>
          <li>Cookie name is AWSALBAPP</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Duration based:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cookie generated by the load balancer</li>
          <li>Cookie name is AWSALB for ALB or AWSELB for CLB</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cross-Zone Load Balancing</h2>
    <p>
      Cross zone load balancing means the load is shared equally across EC2
      instances in different availability zones. For an ALB cross zone load
      balancing is always on. For an NLB this is diabled by default but can be
      enabled at a cost. For the CLB is enabled by default if created in
      console, disabled by default in created via CLI, no charge if enabled.
    </p>

    <h2>SSL/TLS Certificates</h2>
    <p>
      This allows traffic between the client and the load balancer to be
      encrypted in transit. SSL refers to Secure Sockets Layer, TLS refers to
      Transport Layer Security. TLS is the newer version and most certificates
      are TLS even though people still say SSL. SSL certificates have an
      expiration data you set and must be renewed regularly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Load balancer uses an X.509 certificate (SSL/LS certificate). Can manage
      these certificates using ACM (AWS certificate manager). Can also create
      your own certificates and upload them to ACM.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must specify a default certificate, can add an optional list of
      certificates to support multiple domains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clients use SNI (Server Name Indication) to specify the hostname they want
      to reach, SNI Solves the problem of loading multiple SSL certificates onto
      one web server (to serve multiple websites).
    </p>
    <p>Can set a security policy to support older versions of SSL.</p>
    <p>
      Newer SNI protocol requires the client to indicate the hostname of the
      target server for the initial SSL handshake, the server then finds the
      correct certificate (or returns the default one). This only works with ALB
      and NLB (not CLB).
    </p>

    <h2>Connection Draining/Registration Delay</h2>
    <p>
      Called connection draining on CLB, referred to as reregistration delay for
      ALB and NLB.
    </p>
    <p>
      When an EC2 instance is de-registering we want to stop sending requests to
      that instance. We want to ensure there is enough time to complete
      "in-flight requests" while the de-registering is occurring.
    </p>
    <p>
      By default this delay lasts 300 seconds but can be set from 1 second to
      3,600 seconds, choose a time based on how long the requests tend to live
      for.
    </p>

    <h2>Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)</h2>
    <p>
      Automatically scale in our out services based on how much load a service
      is receiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      ASG automates this by setting minimum/maximum number of instances + a
      desired number of instances, then based on criteria we can set such as CPU
      usage we scale our or in our instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      ASGs combined well with load balancers as new instances are automatically
      registered with the load balancer. The ASG will also recreate a new
      instance if a previous one gets terminated due to a failed health check.
    </p>
    <p>ASGs have a launch template:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>AMI + instance type</li>
      <li>EC2 user data</li>
      <li>EBS volumes</li>
      <li>Security groups</li>
      <li>SSH key pair</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We can also define network + subnet information and various scaling
      policies.
    </p>

    <h3>Auto Scaling Alarms</h3>
    <p>Our ASG can scale in or out based on various CloudWatch alarms.</p>
    <p>Scaling rules include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Target average CPU usage</li>
      <li>Number of requests on ELB instance</li>
      <li>Average network in</li>
      <li>Average network out</li>
      <li>Custom metrics such as number of connected users</li>
      <li>Scale based on a schedule</li>
    </ul>
    <p>IAM roles attach to the ASG which apply to the underlying resources.</p>

    <h3>Scaling Policies</h3>
    <p>
      We can set up various scaling policies. We can use different policies for
      scaling in and out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Target tracking scaling - easiest to set up, simple such as maintain 50%
      CPU usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Step scaling - When a CloudWatch alarm is triggered for CPU usage over 70%
      add a new instance, when a CloudWatch alarm is triggered for CPU usage
      less than 30% remove an instance.
    </p>
    <p>Scheduled action - at 5pm on Friday increase capacity to 10.</p>
    <p>
      Predictive scaling - continuously forecast load and schedule scaling
      ahead, utilizes ML.
    </p>
    <p>Metrics to scale on:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>CPU utilization</li>
      <li>Requests per EC2</li>
      <li>Average network in/out</li>
      <li>Custom CloudWatch metrics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      After adding/removing instances there is a scaling cool-down of 300
      seconds by default, this is to allow for new metrics to settle.
    </p>

    <h3>Instance Refresh</h3>
    <p>
      Want to update an entire ASG due to a new launch template to re-create all
      EC2 instances. For this we can use the native features of Instance
      Refresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      We set a minimum healthy X%, this way the ASG will only terminate (100-X)%
      at a time and replace these instances with the new template.
