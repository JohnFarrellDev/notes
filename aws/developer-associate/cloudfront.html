    <h1>CloudFront (CDN)</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      A Content Delivery Network (CDN) improves read performance by caching
      content at edge locations, enhancing user experience. Currently, there are
      216 points of presence (edge locations) globally. Additionally, CDNs
      provide DDoS protection and integrate seamlessly with Shield and AWS Web
      Application Firewall. CloudFront can expose external HTTPS endpoints and
      communicate with internal HTTPS backends. Users interact with the nearest
      edge locations, significantly speeding up data retrieval if the data is
      already cached there.
    </p>

    <h3>CloudFront - Origins</h3>
    <p>
      Amazon S3 buckets are used for distributing files, using CloudFront these
      files can be cached at the edge. Enhanced security is achieved through
      CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI), which ensures that S3 is publicly
      accessible only to specified edge locations. CloudFront can also serve as
      an ingress point for uploading files to S3, further leveraging OAI for
      secure and efficient file distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Custom Origin (HTTP Endpoint) can also be cached, these HTTP endpoints
      include various sources such as an Application Load Balancer, an EC2
      instance, or an S3 website (which requires enabling the bucket as a static
      S3 website first). It can also be any HTTP backend of your choice,
      providing flexibility in handling web traffic and content delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Geo Restriction allows you to restrict access to your distribution by
      whitelisting or blacklisting countries. The country is determined using a
      third-party Geo-IP database. This feature is particularly useful for
      complying with copyright laws regarding access to content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use S3 cross region replication when you want to have content at
      low-latency in a few select regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Use CloudFront if you want static content available everywhere at low
      latency.
    </p>

    <h2>Caching and Caching Policies</h2>
    <p>
      The cache lives at each CloudFront Edge Location, the CloudFront
      identifies each object in the cache using the Cache Key.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a request to the cache the cache first checks if it has the object and
      if the object has not expired based on TTL, if the object is not present
      or expired then the cache calls to the origin. This is a cache miss and we
      want to minimize them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key by default consists of the hostname + resource portion of the URL,
      sometimes the key needs to be more complex such as using user details or
      geo-location information. To do this we create a cache policy which can
      utilise HTTP headers, cookies and query strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Cache Policy we can control the TTL using the Cache-Control header
      or Expires header.
    </p>
    <p>
      All data used for the Cache Policy to create the Cache Key will also be
      included and forwarded in the origin request.
    </p>

    <h3>Headers</h3>
    <p>
      If we define a "NONE" cache policy for the headers then none of the
      headers are cached and none are forwarded except default. This gives us
      the best caching performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to include specified headers in the Cache Key you can set a
      White List, these headers are forwarded to the origin.
    </p>

    <h3>Query String</h3>
    <p>Query string works the same way but has two extra options.</p>

    <p>ALL which includes all query strings in the cache key.</p>
    <p>
      Include All-Except which includes all the query strings in the Cache Key
      except the specified list.
    </p>
    <p>NONE and Whitelist behave the same as for headers.</p>
    <p>
      ALL gives the worst performance as there is more work to generate the
      Cache Key.
    </p>

    <h3>Origin Request Policy</h3>
    <p>
      You can include headers that are forwarded to the origin but not included
      in the Cache Key, this is defined in the Origin Request Policy which is
      separate from the Cache Policy. Maybe the origin requires the user-agent
      which you pass through as a header.
    </p>

    <h2>Cache Invalidations</h2>
    <p>
      The CDN may continue to deliver stale content after an origin updates as
      CloudFront does not know about the update and will only retrieve new
      content after the TTL expires.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can force an entire or partial cache refresh (bypassing the TTL) by
      performing a CloudFront Invalidation.
    </p>
    <p>For example can invalidate a whole path <code>/images/*</code></p>

    <h2>Cache Behaviors</h2>
    <p>
      Can configure different settings based on a different URL path for example
      could cache the path <code>images/*.jpg</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can route to a different origin based on the content type or path pattern.
    </p>

    <h2>ALB as an Origin</h2>
    <p>
      CloudFront can utilise an EC2 instance as the origin. The security group
      on the instance must allow network requests from the ClodFront IP address.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively CloudFront can point at an ALB which accepts the public IPs
      from CloudFront, in turn the EC2 instance can be private and only allow
      requests from the ALB instance.
    </p>

    <h2>Geo Restriction</h2>
    <p>
      Can restrict who access to your distribution, commonly done for copyright
      law reasons. This can be enforced using an Allowlist or Blocklist,
      implementation is done by checking incoming IPs against a 33rd party
      Geo-IP database.
    </p>

    <h2>CloudFront Signed Url/Cookies</h2>
    <p>Want to distribute content but only to premium users.</p>
    <p>
      This can be implemented using a CloudFront Signed URL/Cookie. We attach a
      policy with URL expiration, IP ranges to access the data, trusted Signers
      (which AWS accounts can create signed URLs).
    </p>
    <p>
      How long should the URL be valid for? Shared content, such as a movie,
      should have a short validity period, while private content for a user can
      be valid for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Signed URLs provide access to individual files, whereas signed cookies
      allow access to multiple files with a single cookie.
    </p>
    <p>
      CloudFront Signed URL allows access to a path regardless of the origin. It
      uses an account-wide key-pair, managed only by the root account. It can
      filter access by IP, path, date, and expiration, and can leverage caching
      features.
    </p>
    <p>
      S3 pre-signed URLs issue a request as the person who pre-signed the URL,
      using the IAM key of the signing IAM principal. These URLs have a limited
      lifetime.
    </p>

    <h2>Signed URL Process</h2>
    <p>
      There are two types of signers for CloudFront: Trusted key groups and AWS
      accounts containing a CloudFront key pair. Trusted key groups are
      recommended as they can leverage APIs to create and rotate keys, using IAM
      for API security. AWS account key pairs require key management using the
      root account and the AWS console, which is not recommended.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can create one or more trusted key groups in a CloudFront
      distribution. Additionally, you can generate your own public/private keys,
      where the private key is used by applications (such as an EC2 instance) to
      sign URLs and the public key is uploaded to CloudFront to verify URLs.
    </p>

    <h2>CloudFront Advanced Concepts</h2>
    <h3>Pricing</h3>
    <p>
      The cost of data per edge location varies. The more data you transfer out
      of a location, the lower the cost per GB. You can also reduce the number
      of edge locations to lower costs. There are three price classes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>All regions: Most expensive, best performance.</li>
      <li>200: Most regions, but excludes the most expensive regions.</li>
      <li>100: Only the least expensive regions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Multiple Origins</h3>
    <p>
      You can route to different origins based on content type. This can be
      configured based on path patterns (e.g., /images/*). Depending on the
      path, requests could be directed to either an S3 bucket or an Application
      Load Balancer (ALB).
    </p>
    <h3>Origin Groups</h3>
    <p>
      Origin groups increase availability and enable failover. If the primary
      origin group fails, traffic can failover to a second origin. For example,
      this can involve two EC2 instances or S3 buckets in different regions that
      have replication between the buckets.
    </p>
    <h3>Field Level Encryption</h3>
    <p>
      Field level encryption protects sensitive information throughout the stack
      by adding an additional layer around HTTPS. Sensitive information is
      encrypted at the edge, closer to the user, using asymmetric encryption.
      This is particularly important for encrypting sensitive POST requests,
      such as bank information, and can encrypt up to 10 fields. You specify the
      public key to encrypt the data at the edge location, while the web server
      has the private key to decrypt the data.
    </p>

    <h2>Real Time Logs</h2>
    <p>
      Is possible to get all real-time requests received by CloudFront sent to a
      Kinesis Data Stream to monitor, analyse and take actions by forwarding the
      records to AWS lambda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can choose a sampling rate so only a % of requests sent to Kinesis, can
      also set specific patterns to log such as only requests to /images or for
      certain cache behavior.
