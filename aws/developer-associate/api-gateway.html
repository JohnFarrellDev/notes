    <h1>API Gateway</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>
      API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers
      to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. Here
      are its key features and capabilities:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Make our Lambda functions accessible via API calls</li>
      <li>Support for WebSocket protocol</li>
      <li>Handle API versioning</li>
      <li>Handle different environments (dev, prod)</li>
      <li>Handle security (authentication and authorization)</li>
      <li>Create API keys</li>
      <li>Request throttling</li>
      <li>Swagger/Open API import to define APIs</li>
      <li>Transform and validate requests/responses</li>
      <li>Generate SDK and API specifications</li>
      <li>Cache API responses</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      API Gateway acts as a "front door" for applications to access data,
      business logic, or functionality from your backend services, such as
      workloads running on EC2, code running on AWS Lambda, or any web
      application. It provides a RESTful API interface that is customizable and
      can integrate with any AWS API services.
    </p>

    <h3>Integrates With</h3>

    <h4>Lambda Function</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Easy way to expose REST API backed by AWS Lambda</li>
      <li>Invoke Lambda function</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>HTTP</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Expose HTTP endpoints in the backend</li>
      <li>Why: Add rate limiting, caching, user authentication, API keys</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>AWS Service</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Expose any AWS API through the API Gateway</li>
      <li>
        Example: Start an AWS Step Function workflow, post a message to SQS
      </li>
      <li>Why: Add authentication, deploy publicly, rate limit</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Endpoint Types</h3>

    <h4>Edge-Optimized</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>For global clients</li>
      <li>
        Requests routed through CloudFront edge locations for improved latency
      </li>
      <li>API Gateway lives in only one region</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Regional</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>For clients within the same region</li>
      <li>
        Could manually combine with CloudFront (more control over the caching
        strategies and distribution)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Private</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Can only be accessed from your VPC using an interface VPC endpoint (ENI)
      </li>
      <li>Use a resource policy to define access</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      API Gateway's integration capabilities allow it to work seamlessly with
      various AWS services and external HTTP endpoints. This flexibility enables
      developers to create powerful, scalable APIs that can leverage the full
      range of AWS services.
    </p>

    <p>
      The different endpoint types cater to various use cases, from globally
      distributed applications to private, secure APIs within a VPC. Choosing
      the right endpoint type depends on your specific requirements for
      performance, security, and geographic distribution of your clients.
    </p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>
      API Gateway supports various security mechanisms to secure your APIs.
      These include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>User authentication through IAM roles for internal applications</li>
      <li>API keys for public APIs to track usage</li>
      <li>OAuth 2.0 for authentication with AWS Cognito</li>
      <li>Custom authorizers for more complex authentication logic</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Custom Domain Name HTTPS security through integration with AWS Certificate
      Manager (ACM) certificates
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If edge-optimized the certificate needs to be in us-east-1 (N. Virginia)
        region
      </li>
      <li>
        If regional, the certificate must be in the same region as the API
        Gateway
      </li>
      <li>Must setup CNAME or A-record in Route 53</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Stages and Deployment</h2>

    <p>
      Understanding the deployment process in API Gateway is crucial for
      effective API management:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Making changes in the API Gateway does not mean they're effective
        immediately
      </li>
      <li>You need to make a "deployment" for changes to take effect</li>
      <li>
        Changes are deployed to stages; you can have as many stages as you want
        and name them what you want
      </li>
      <li>Stages can be rolled back as a history of deployments is kept</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stage Variables</h3>

    <p>
      Stage variables are like environment variables for API Gateway. They offer
      flexibility in managing your API configurations:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Use them to change often changing configuration values</li>
      <li>
        Can be used in:
        <ul>
          <li>Lambda function ARN</li>
          <li>HTTP endpoint</li>
          <li>Parameter mapping templates</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Use cases:
        <ul>
          <li>Configure HTTP endpoints your stages talk to</li>
          <li>
            Pass configuration parameters to AWS Lambda through mapping
            templates
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Stage variables are passed to the "context" object in AWS Lambda</li>
      <li>The format is: ${stageVariables.variableName}</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Stage variables provide a powerful way to manage different configurations
      for your API across various stages (e.g., development, testing,
      production). They allow you to change behavior of your API without
      changing the API setup, making it easier to manage multiple environments
      or versions of your API.

    />

    <h2>Canary Deployments</h2>

    <p>
      API Gateway supports canary deployments, allowing you to test new versions
      of your API with a subset of your traffic before fully rolling out
      changes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Possible to enable canary deployments for any stage, typically used for
        production
      </li>
      <li>Choose the percentage of traffic the "canary" channel receives</li>
      <li>
        For example, 95% of traffic goes to the original stage, 5% to the canary
        stage (these percentages can be adjusted)
      </li>
      <li>Metrics and logs are kept separate for each stage</li>
      <li>
        If the canary stage is performing well, you can promote the canary
        channel to become the main stage
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Canary deployments provide several benefits:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Risk Mitigation: Test new features or changes with a small portion of
        your traffic, minimizing the impact of potential issues
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradual Rollout: Slowly increase the percentage of traffic to the new
        version as confidence grows
      </li>
      <li>
        Easy Rollback: If issues are detected, traffic can be quickly redirected
        back to the original version
      </li>
      <li>
        Performance Comparison: Direct comparison of metrics between the
        original and canary versions
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This approach to deployment allows for safer, more controlled updates to
      your API, reducing the risk of widespread issues and providing a mechanism
      for gathering real-world performance data before full deployment.
    </p>

    <h2>Integration Types and Mappings</h2>

    <h3>Integration Types</h3>

    <h4>MOCK</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Return a response without sending a request to the backend for testing
        purposes
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>HTTP/AWS (Lambda and other services)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Must configure both the integration request and response</li>
      <li>
        Setup data mapping using mapping templates for the request and response
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>AWS_PROXY (Lambda Proxy)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Incoming request from the client is the input to the Lambda</li>
      <li>The function is responsible for the logic of request/response</li>
      <li>No mapping templates</li>
      <li>
        Headers, query string parameters, body, etc. are passed as arguments
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>HTTP_PROXY</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>No mapping template</li>
      <li>HTTP request passed to the backend</li>
      <li>HTTP response from the backend is forwarded by API Gateway</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mapping Templates</h3>
    <p>Mapping templates can be used to modify the request and response:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rename/Modify query string parameters</li>
      <li>Modify body content</li>
      <li>Add headers</li>
      <li>Uses Velocity Template Language (VTL): for loop, if, etc.</li>
      <li>Filter output results (remove unnecessary data)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example: Mapping JSON to XML with SOAP</h3>
    <p>
      API Gateway can act as a translator between JSON-based REST APIs and
      XML-based SOAP APIs:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>SOAP APIs are XML based whereas REST APIs are JSON based</li>
      <li>
        API Gateway needs to extract data from the request (path, payload,
        header)
      </li>
      <li>
        Build SOAP message to forward to API, send SOAP message to backend
      </li>
      <li>Receive XML response from the API</li>
      <li>Convert XML to JSON to return to the users</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These integration types and mapping capabilities make API Gateway a
      powerful tool for creating, managing, and transforming APIs. They allow
      you to adapt to various backend systems, perform data transformations, and
      even act as a bridge between different API paradigms like REST and SOAP.
    </p>

    <h2>Swagger and OpenAPI 3.0</h2>

    <p>
      Swagger and OpenAPI 3.0 provide a common way of defining REST APIs using
      API definition as code. This approach offers several benefits when working
      with API Gateway:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Import existing Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0 spec to API Gateway:
        <ul>
          <li>Method</li>
          <li>Method request</li>
          <li>Integration request</li>
          <li>Method response</li>
          <li>
            Plus AWS extensions for API Gateway and setup of every single option
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Can export current API as Swagger/OpenAPI</li>
      <li>Swagger can be written in YAML or JSON</li>
      <li>Using Swagger, we can generate SDK for our applications</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This integration between Swagger/OpenAPI and API Gateway streamlines the
      process of creating, documenting, and managing APIs. It allows developers
      to define their APIs in a standardized format and easily import them into
      API Gateway, as well as export existing APIs for documentation or further
      development.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ability to generate SDKs from Swagger definitions is particularly
      useful, as it can significantly reduce the time and effort required to
      integrate the API into client applications across various programming
      languages and platforms.
    </p>

    <h2>Gateway Caching</h2>

    <p>
      API Gateway offers caching capabilities to improve performance and reduce
      load on your backend services. Here are the key points about Gateway
      Caching:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Reduces the number of calls made to the backend</li>
      <li>Default TTL (Time To Live) is 300 seconds</li>
      <li>Caches are defined per stage</li>
      <li>Possible to override cache settings per method</li>
      <li>Cache encryption option available</li>
      <li>Cache capacity ranges between 0.5GB to 237GB</li>
      <li>
        Cache is expensive, makes sense in production but not in
        development/test environments
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Implementing caching in API Gateway can significantly improve the
      performance of your API, especially for frequently accessed data that
      doesn't change often. By serving responses from the cache, you can reduce
      latency for your API consumers and decrease the load on your backend
      systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, it's important to carefully consider your caching strategy. While
      caching can provide substantial benefits in production environments with
      high traffic, it may not be cost-effective for development or testing
      stages where traffic is lower and frequent changes are being made to the
      API.
    </p>

    <p>
      When implementing caching, consider factors such as the volatility of your
      data, the acceptable level of data staleness for your use case, and the
      traffic patterns of your API. You may need to adjust cache settings for
      different API methods based on these considerations.
    </p>

    <h3>Cache Invalidation</h3>

    <p>API Gateway provides methods to invalidate the cache when needed:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Able to flush the entire cache immediately from the AWS Console</li>
      <li>
        Clients can invalidate the cache with the header
        <code>Cache-Control:max-age=0</code> if they have proper IAM
        authorization
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Cache invalidation is crucial for ensuring that your API consumers always
      receive the most up-to-date information. The ability to flush the cache
      from the AWS Console is useful for administrative purposes, while allowing
      clients to invalidate the cache gives you fine-grained control over cache
      behavior at the request level.
    </p>

    <h2>Usage Plans and API Keys</h2>

    <h3>Usage Plan</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Defines who can access one or more deployed API stages and methods
      </li>
      <li>Controls how much and how fast they can access the API</li>
      <li>Uses API keys to identify API clients and meter access</li>
      <li>Configures throttling limits and quota limits enforced on clients</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>API Keys</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Alphanumeric string values to distribute to your customers</li>
      <li>Can be used with usage plans to control access</li>
      <li>Throttling limits are applied at the API key level</li>
      <li>Quota limits represent the overall number of maximum requests</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Configuring a Usage Plan</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Create one or more APIs, configure the methods to require an API key,
        and deploy the APIs to stages
      </li>
      <li>
        Generate or import API keys to distribute to application developers
        (customers)
      </li>
      <li>Create a usage plan with desired throttle and quota limits</li>
      <li>Associate API stages and API keys with the usage plan</li>
      <li>
        Callers of the API must supply an API key in the
        <code>x-api-key</code> header in the request to the API
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Usage Plans and API Keys provide a powerful mechanism for controlling and
      monitoring access to your APIs. They allow you to manage who can access
      your APIs, set limits on how much they can use them, and track usage per
      client. This is particularly useful for monetizing APIs, enforcing service
      level agreements, or managing resources in multi-tenant environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      By requiring API keys and associating them with usage plans, you can
      create different tiers of access, implement rate limiting to protect your
      backend services from overload, and gather detailed analytics on API usage
      patterns. This granular control helps in maintaining the performance and
      security of your APIs while providing flexibility in how you expose your
      services to different clients or customer groups.
    </p>

    <h2>Monitoring, Logging and Tracing</h2>

    <h3>CloudWatch Logs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Enable CloudWatch logging at the Stage level (with log level)</li>
      <li>Can override settings on a per API basis</li>
      <li>Log contains information about request/response body</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>X-Ray</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Enable tracing to get extra information about requests in API Gateway
      </li>
      <li>X-Ray API Gateway + AWS Lambda gives you all the information</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>CloudWatch Metrics</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Metrics are by stage</li>
      <li>Can enable detailed metrics</li>
      <li>CacheHitCount and CacheMissCount to understand cache efficiency</li>
      <li>Count - total number of API requests in a given period</li>
      <li>
        IntegrationLatency - time between when API Gateway relays a request to
        the backend and when it receives a response
      </li>
      <li>
        Latency - time between when API Gateway receives a request from the
        client and when it returns a response to the client (integration latency
        + gateway overhead)
      </li>
      <li>Max time an API Gateway request lasts is 29 seconds</li>
      <li>4XX errors (client-side errors)</li>
      <li>5XX errors (server-side errors)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Throttling</h3>
    <h4>Account Limit</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        API Gateway throttles requests at 10,000 requests per second across all
        APIs
      </li>
      <li>Soft limit that can be increased on request</li>
      <li>In case of throttling, see 429 Too Many Requests error</li>
      <li>Can try exponential backoff retries</li>
      <li>
        Can set stage limit and method limits to improve performance (so one
        stage doesn't use all the quota)
      </li>
      <li>Or use usage plan to throttle a certain customer</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>4XX Errors (Client Side)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>400 - Bad Request</li>
      <li>403 - Access Denied, WAF filtered</li>
      <li>429 - Quota Exceeded, Throttle</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>5XX Errors (Server Side)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        502 - Bad Gateway Exception, usually for an incompatible output returned
        from a Lambda proxy integration
      </li>
      <li>503 - Service Unavailable Exception</li>
      <li>
        504 - Integration Failure - Request Timeout Exception, request took
        longer than 29 seconds
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Effective monitoring, logging, and tracing are crucial for maintaining and
      optimizing your API Gateway. CloudWatch Logs provide detailed information
      about requests and responses, while X-Ray offers deep insights into
      request flows, especially when integrated with Lambda. CloudWatch Metrics
      give you quantitative data on your API's performance and usage.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding and managing throttling is key to ensuring your API's
      stability and fairness of access. By setting appropriate limits and
      handling throttling errors gracefully, you can protect your backend
      services from overload and provide a consistent experience to your API
      consumers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Familiarity with common error codes helps in quick troubleshooting and
      resolution of issues. 4XX errors indicate client-side problems that often
      require action from the API consumer, while 5XX errors point to
      server-side issues that you as the API provider need to address.
    </p>

    <h2>CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)</h2>

    <p>
      CORS is a crucial security feature that controls how web applications from
      one domain can interact with resources from a different domain. In the
      context of API Gateway:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Must be enabled to receive API calls from another domain</li>
      <li>
        The OPTIONS pre-flight request must contain the following headers:
        <ul>
          <li>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</li>
          <li>Access-Control-Allow-Headers</li>
          <li>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>CORS can be enabled through the console</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When CORS is not properly configured, browsers will block requests from
      your web application to your API Gateway endpoints if they are hosted on
      different domains. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized
      cross-origin access.
    </p>

    <p>
      Enabling CORS in API Gateway allows you to specify which domains can
      access your API, what HTTP methods are allowed, and what headers can be
      used in the request. This gives you fine-grained control over access to
      your API resources.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's important to note that while CORS can be easily enabled through the
      AWS Console, you should carefully consider your CORS configuration to
      ensure it's not overly permissive. Only allow access from trusted domains
      and with the minimum necessary permissions to maintain the security of
      your API.
    </p>

    />

    <h2>Authentication and Authorization</h2>

    <h3>IAM Authentication and Authorization</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Create an IAM policy for authorization and attach to User/Role</li>
      <li>Authentication = IAM</li>
      <li>Authorization = IAM Policy</li>
      <li>Good to provide access within AWS</li>
      <li>Leverage Sig v4 capability where IAM credentials are in headers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Resource Policies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Allow for cross account access combined with IAM security</li>
      <li>Allow for a specific source IP address</li>
      <li>Allow for a VPC endpoint</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cognito User Pools</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cognito fully manages user lifecycle</li>
      <li>Token expires automatically</li>
      <li>API gateway verifies identity automatically from AWS Cognito</li>
      <li>No custom implementation required</li>
      <li>Authentication = Cognito user pools</li>
      <li>Authorization = API gateway methods</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lambda Authorizer</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Token-based authorizer (bearer token) - ex JWT or OAuth</li>
      <li>Request-based parameter, either in headers or query string</li>
      <li>
        Lambda must return an IAM policy for the user, result policy is cached
      </li>
      <li>Authentication = External</li>
      <li>Authorization = Lambda function</li>
      <li>Used for third party authentication</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      API Gateway offers multiple methods for authentication and authorization,
      each suited to different use cases:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>IAM Authentication and Authorization</strong> is ideal for
        internal AWS services and applications where you want to leverage
        existing IAM users and roles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Resource Policies</strong> provide additional control, allowing
        you to restrict access based on source IP or VPC endpoint, or enable
        cross-account access.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cognito User Pools</strong> offer a fully managed user
        authentication service, perfect for customer-facing applications where
        you don't want to handle user management yourself.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lambda Authorizers</strong> provide the most flexibility,
        allowing you to implement custom authentication logic or integrate with
        third-party authentication providers.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Choosing the right authentication and authorization method depends on your
      specific use case, security requirements, and the nature of your API
      consumers. It's crucial to carefully consider these options to ensure your
      API is both secure and accessible to the right users.

    <h2>REST API vs HTTP API</h2>

    <h3>HTTP APIs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Low-latency</li>
      <li>Cost-effective AWS Lambda proxy</li>
      <li>HTTP proxy APIs and private integration (no mapping of data)</li>
      <li>
        Only supports OIDC and OAuth 2.0 authorization and built-in support for
        CORS
      </li>
      <li>No usage plans and API keys</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>REST APIs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All features except Native OpenID Connect/OAuth 2.0</li>
      <li>Has usage plans and API keys</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      API Gateway offers two main types of APIs: HTTP APIs and REST APIs. Each
      type has its own strengths and is suited for different use cases:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>HTTP APIs</strong> are designed for simplicity and performance.
      They're ideal for scenarios where you need basic API functionality with
      low latency and cost. They're particularly well-suited for serverless
      applications using AWS Lambda, or for creating simple proxy APIs. However,
      they have limitations in terms of advanced features and authorization
      options.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>REST APIs</strong> offer a fuller feature set and more
      flexibility. They support a wider range of integration types and
      authorization methods, and include features like usage plans and API keys.
      This makes them suitable for more complex API scenarios where you need
      fine-grained control over API behavior, request/response transformations,
      or advanced monitoring and throttling capabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      When choosing between HTTP APIs and REST APIs, consider factors such as
      your performance requirements, the complexity of your API, your
      authorization needs, and whether you need features like usage plans or API
      keys. HTTP APIs might be sufficient for simple, high-performance APIs,
      while REST APIs are better for more complex, feature-rich API
      implementations.

    <h2>WebSocket API</h2>

    <p>
      WebSocket APIs in API Gateway enable two-way interactive communication
      between clients and servers, offering several advantages:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Two-way interactive communication between client and server</li>
      <li>Server can push data to the client</li>
      <li>Enables stateful applications</li>
      <li>
        Often used in real-time applications, chat applications, collaborative
        platforms, multiplayer games, financial trading platforms
      </li>
      <li>Works with AWS services or HTTP endpoints</li>
    </ul>

      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/api-gateway-websocket.png"
      alt="WebSocket API Architecture"
    />

    <p>Key features of WebSocket APIs in API Gateway:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Incoming JSON messages are routed to different backends</li>
      <li>If no routes are specified, messages are sent to $default</li>
      <li>
        You can specify a route selection expression to select the field on JSON
        to route from
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Operations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>POST - send a message from the server to the client</li>
      <li>
        GET - gets the latest connection states of the connected WebSocket
        client
      </li>
      <li>
        DELETE - disconnect the connected client from the WebSocket connection
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Architecture</h2>

    <p>
      API Gateway can serve as a central interface for all microservices in your
      company, providing several benefits:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Create a single interface for all the microservices in your company
      </li>
      <li>Use API endpoints with various resources</li>
      <li>Apply a simple domain name and SSL certificates</li>
      <li>
        Can apply forwarding and transformation rules at the API gateway level
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This architectural approach allows for a more streamlined and manageable
      API structure. By centralizing your APIs through API Gateway, you can
      simplify client interactions, improve security with a single point of
      entry, and gain more control over how requests are processed and routed to
      your backend services.
    </p>

    <p>
      The ability to apply forwarding and transformation rules at the API
      Gateway level is particularly powerful. It allows you to modify requests
      and responses as they pass through the gateway, enabling you to adapt your
      backend services' interfaces to meet the needs of your API consumers
      without changing the backend code.
