    <h1>AWS CLI, SDK, IAM Roles and Policies</h1>

    <h2>EC2 Instance Metadata (IMDS)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        EC2 instances can learn about themselves without using an IAM role for
        that purpose
      </li>
      <li>
        URL is http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ and can be accessed by
        IMDSv1 directly
      </li>
      <li>
        IMDSv2 however is enabled by default and is more secure, you access the
        metadata with 2 steps.
        <ul>
          <li>
            First you make a put request to
            http://169.254.196.254/latest/api/token which returns a session
            token
          </li>
          <li>
            You then make a second call to
            http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/profile and pass the token
            in from the previous step
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Can retrieve the IAM Role name from the metadata, CANNOT retrieve the
        IAM policy
      </li>
      <li>Metadata is info about instance</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AWS CLI Profiles</h2>
    <p>
      You may have multiple AWS accounts. Your command line AWS config and
      credentials will have your AWS access key and secret access key, if you
      have multiple accounts you can create multiple profiles each with their
      own unique keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      You create a new profile by running
      <code>aws configure --profile <new-profile-name></new-profile-name></code>
    </p>
    <p>
      One of your accounts can be set as your default account, this information
      is found within credentials and config within your root .aws folder.
    </p>

    <h2>AWS CLI with MFA</h2>
    <p>
      You may want to utilise MFA when using the CLI or SDK. To this you need to
      create a token from the CLI.
    </p>
    <p>
      You make a request to STS (Security Token Service) GetSessionToken, the
      command looks like
      <code
        >aws sts get-session-token --&lt;mfa ARN code&gt; &lt;serial number from
        MFA app&gt; --duration-seconds &lt;duration-in-seconds (3600)&gt;</code
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      After the running command you will get a response with an AccessKeyId,
      SecretAccessKey and SessionToken.
    </p>
    <p>
      You now configure your AWS profile with these values which will work until
      the SessionToken expires.
    </p>

    <h2>AWS SDK Overview</h2>
    <p>
      SDK stands for software development kit, it means we can write application
      code that calls to AWS operations in a variety of languages such as Java,
      Go, .NET, ruby, node etc.
    </p>
    <p>The AWS CLI actually uses the Python SDK known as boto3.</p>
    <p>We commonly use the SDK when we utilise lambda functions.</p>
    <p>
      If we do not specify a region in the SDK us-east-1 is used by default.
    </p>

    <h2>Exponential Backoff and Service Limit Increase</h2>
    <p>
      There are API rate limits, for example the EC2 API has a limit of 100
      calls per second, GetObject on S3 has a limit of 5,500 GET per second per
      prefix. If we go over we will get a error, if we get intermittent errors
      we can implement an exponential backoff. For consistent errors we can
      require a limit increase before throttling occurs from AWS.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also have service quota limits, for example 1,125 vCPU instances are
      allowed but using the ServiceQuota API the limit can be increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      With exponential backoff a retry mechanism is already included in the AWS
      SDK, must implement yourself if using the API directly. A retry only
      occurs on a 5xx error and not a 4xx error. Between each failed request the
      retry time doubles.
    </p>

    <h2>AWS Credentials Provider and Chain</h2>
    <p>The CLI will look for credentials in the following order:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Command line options: --region, --output and --profile</li>
      <li>
        Environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
        AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
      </li>
      <li>CLI credentials file from aws configure</li>
      <li>CLI configuration file from aws configure</li>
      <li>Contain credentials for ECS tasks</li>
      <li>Instance profile credentials for EC2 instance profiles</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      SDK will do the same but start with java system properties (if using java
      SDK).
    </p>
    <p>
      Never store credentials in code, using the credential inheritance chain.
    </p>

    <h2>AWS Signature v4 Signing (Sigv4)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When calling AWS API we sign the request (some don't require to be
        signed such as reading a public object) using our access key and secret
        key
      </li>
      <li>If using SDK or CLI the request is already signed for you</li>
      <li>You need to sign a request use SigV4</li>
      <li>
        Can sign using HTTP passing the signature in the authorization header
      </li>
      <li>
        The second option is to use a query string X-Amz-Signature when making
        the request
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>IAM Roles and Policies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>AWS has pre-built policies</li>
      <li>You can create your own policies</li>
      <li>
        AWS has a handful visual editor for creating the policy JSON object
      </li>
      <li>
        There is also an AWS policy generator which uses a form to create the
        JSON policy
      </li>
      <li>You can also view a policy summary within AWS</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AWS Policy Simulator</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>An online tool to test your policy</li>
      <li>Create user and try and call AWS APIs</li>
      <li>Policy simulator will show if permission is allowed or denied</li>
      <li>If denied can click to see the policy for denial reason</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AWS CLI Dry Run</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Sometimes we want to test we have permissions without actually running
        the commands (save on cost)
      </li>
      <li>
        Some AWS CLI commands contain a --dry-run option to simulate API calls
      </li>
      <li>
        Tells us if operation would have succeeded or failed without actually
        running the operation
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>AWS CLI STS Decode</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>AWS API error messages are encoded</li>
      <li>AWS messages can be decoded with AWS STS</li>
      <li>The message is JSON formatted</li>
    </ul>
