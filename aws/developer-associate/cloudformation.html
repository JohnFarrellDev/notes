    <h1>CloudFormation</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is implemented through CloudFormation on AWS.
      Elastic Beanstalk uses CloudFormation under the hood. IaC aims to reduce
      manual work, making it easier to reproduce infrastructure in another
      region or account, and to recreate it if deleted. By deploying code that
      updates our infrastructure and versioning it with Git, we gain numerous
      advantages.
    </p>
    <p>
      CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS infrastructure
      for most AWS resources using <code>YAML</code>. It creates infrastructure
      in the order specified in the template. Changes to infrastructure can be
      reviewed for cost implications. CloudFormation itself is free, with each
      resource tagged with an identifier, allowing cost estimation from the
      template. It also enables cost-saving measures, such as automatically
      deleting development instances between 5 PM and 8 AM.
    </p>
    <p>
      CloudFormation boosts productivity by making it easy to recreate
      infrastructure on the cloud. It allows automated generation of diagrams
      from templates and supports declarative programming. Separation of
      concerns is possible with multiple tags, such as VPC stack, network stack,
      and app stack. You can leverage existing templates, avoiding the need to
      reinvent the wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Templates are uploaded to S3 and then referenced in CloudFormation. To
      edit a template, upload a new one; existing templates cannot be edited.
      Stacks are identified by a name, and deleting a stack removes every single
      artifact created by CloudFormation with one click, preventing accidental
      retention of old instances.
    </p>
    <p>A CloudFormation template could say:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I want a security group</li>
      <li>I want two EC2 instances using that security group</li>
      <li>I want two Elastic IPs for those EC2 instances</li>
      <li>I want an S3 bucket</li>
      <li>I want a load balancer in front of those EC2 instances</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      CloudFormation then creates everything for you in the right order with the
      configuration specified.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can visualize the components and how they interact with Application
      Composer.
    </p>
    <p>
      CloudFormation allows for separation of concerns as you can create many
      stacks for many apps and many layers, such as VPC stacks or App stacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because CloudFormation is IaC you can reuse the code to save time and
      avoid re-inventing the wheel and can leverage existing templates on the
      web.

    />

    <h2>Building Blocks</h2>
    <h3>Template Components</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>AWSTemplateFormatVersion</strong> - identified the capabilities
        of the template
      </li>
      <li><strong>Description</strong> - comments about the template</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Resources (Mandatory)</strong> - AWS resources declared in the
        template
      </li>
      <li><strong>Parameters</strong> - Dynamic inputs for your template</li>
      <li><strong>Mappings</strong> - Static variables for your template</li>
      <li><strong>Outputs</strong> - References to what has been created</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Conditionals</strong> - list of conditions to perform resource
        creation
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Template Helpers</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>References</li>
      <li>Functions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Update and Delete Stack</h2>
    <p>
      To update our config file, we need to upload a new file each time
      (creating a new version in S3). CloudFormation looks at the differences
      between the config files and applies the required changes, which can
      require an approval step in the UI. CloudFormation will delete
      infrastructure in the correct order.
    </p>

    <h2>YAML</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>JSON is cumbersome for CloudFormation but can be used.</li>
      <li>YAML is far superior.</li>
      <li>YAML utilizes key:value pairs.</li>
      <li>
        Supports nested objects and arrays (array keys shown using hyphens).
      </li>
      <li>
        Multi-line string support (shown by a "|" at the start of the string)
      </li>
      <li>Can include comments. (text preceded by a "#")</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>
      Resources are the core of a CloudFormation template and are mandatory.
      They represent AWS components and are declared in the template, allowing
      them to reference each other. AWS manages the creation, update, and
      deletion of resources for us. There are over 700 AWS resources, with
      documentation available for each.
    </p>

    <p>
      Resource identifiers are in the form
      <code>service-provider::service-name::data-type-name</code>. A resource
      can have a list of properties that define its behavior, such as
      <code>AvailabilityZone</code>. You cannot create a dynamic amount of
      resources; everything in CloudFormation must be declared, with no code
      generation. Almost all resources are supported, and those that are not can
      be worked around using AWS Lambda Custom Resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example an EC2 instance resource could look like:
      <code>AWS::EC2::Instance</code>.
    </p>
    <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html"
      class="external-link"
      >AWS CloudFormation Resource Reference Guide</a
    >
    <p>
      Making dynamic resources is possible using CloudFormation Macros and
      Transform but is outside the scope of a developer associate.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a resource is not supported you can use a CloudFormation Custom
      Resource as a workaround.
    </p>

    <h2>CloudFormation Parameters</h2>
    <p>
      Parameters are a way to provide inputs to your CloudFormation template,
      making it easier to reuse templates and handle inputs that cannot be
      determined ahead of time. They are particularly useful if the
      CloudFormation configuration is likely to change in the future.
    </p>
    <p>Parameters are controlled by various settings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Types:
        <ul>
          <li>String</li>
          <li>Number</li>
          <li>CommaDelimitedList</li>
          <li>List&lt;Type&gt;</li>
          <li>AWS Parameter</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Description</li>
      <li>Constraints</li>
      <li>ConstraintDescription</li>
      <li>Min/MaxLength</li>
      <li>Min/MaxValue</li>
      <li>Defaults</li>
      <li>AllowedValues (array)</li>
      <li>AllowedPattern (regex)</li>
      <li>NoEcho (boolean)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Reference a parameter in YAML using
      <code>!Ref &lt;ParameterName&gt;</code>. You can also reference other
      resources in the same way.
    </p>
    <img
      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-parameter.png"
    />
    <strong>Pseudo Parameters</strong>
    <p>
      AWS offers pseudo parameters in any CloudFormation template, which can be
      used at any time and are enabled by default. Examples include
      <code>AWS::AccountId</code> and <code>AWS::Region</code>.
    </p>

    <h2>Mappings</h2>
    <p>
      Mappings are fixed variables in your CloudFormation template. They are
      useful for differentiating between different environments, such as dev vs.
      prod, or different regions. All values in mappings are hardcoded within
      the template.
    </p>
    <p>
      We can use the <code>Fn::FindInMap</code> to return a named value from a
      specified key.
    </p>
    <img
      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-mapping.png"
    />
    <p>
      Mappings are good when you know in advance all the values that can be
      taken, such as region, AZ, or AWS account. They allow safer control over
      the template, with only one value to update. Use parameters when values
      are user-specific or when you don't know in advance what the value needs
      to be.
    </p>

    <h2>Outputs and Exports</h2>
    <p>
      The Outputs section is optional but useful for various purposes. You can
      import outputs into other CloudFormation templates if they are exported
      first. Outputs can be viewed in the AWS console or AWS CLI.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you define a network in CloudFormation, you can output the
      VPC ID and your Subnet IDs. This is the best way to perform cross-stack
      collaboration. Note that you cannot delete a CloudFormation stack if the
      output is referenced somewhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      To create a second template that utilizes the output from the first
      template, use <code>!ImportValue &lt;ValueName&gt;</code> in your second
      template.
    </p>

    <img
      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-import.png"
    />

    <h2>Conditions</h2>
    <p>
      Conditions are used to control the creation of resources based on factors
      such as the environment (dev or test) or AWS region. Each condition can
      reference another condition if required. The only logical conditions
      available are <code>And</code>, <code>Equals</code>, <code>If</code>,
      <code>Not</code>, and <code>Or</code>. You can apply a condition to a
      resource to control its creation.
    </p>

    />

    <h2>Intrinsic Functions</h2>
    <p>Bold you must know</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Fn::Ref</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Fn::GetAtt</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Fn::FindInMap</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Fn::ImportValue</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Condition Functions</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Fn::Base64</strong></li>
      <li>Fn::Join</li>
      <li>Fn::Sub</li>
      <li>Fn::ForEach</li>
      <li>Fn::ToJsonString</li>
      <li>Fn::Cidr</li>
      <li>Fn::GetAZs</li>
      <li>Fn::Select</li>
      <li>Fn::Split</li>
      <li>Fn::Transform</li>
      <li>Fn::Length</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Ref</h3>
    <p>
      The function can be leveraged to return the value of a parameter or the
      underlying resource.
    </p>
    <h3>GetAtt</h3>
    <p>
      Attributes are attached to any resource you create, you can use GetAtt to
      access them, for example finding what AZ an instance was launched in. Can
      only get what attributes CloudFormation supports.
    </p>
    <img
      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-get-attribute-example.png"
    />
    <h3>FindInMap</h3>
    <p>
      Returns a named value from a specific key within a map. Useful for
      differentiating between different environments or regions.
    </p>
    <h3>ImportValue</h3>
    <p>
      Imports the value of an output exported by another stack. Useful for
      cross-stack collaboration.
    </p>
    <h3>Condition Functions</h3>
    <p>To conditionally create resources based on a condition.</p>
    <h3>Base64</h3>
    <p>
      Encodes the specified string to Base64. Useful for encoding user data
      passed to EC2 instances.
    </p>

    <h2>Rollbacks</h2>
    <h3>Stack Creation Fail</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If stack creation fails, by default everything rolls back and is
        deleted.
      </li>
      <li>Option to disable rollback and troubleshoot what happened.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Stack Update Fail</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Rolls back to the previous known working state.</li>
      <li>Ability to log what happened and see error messages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If a rollback fails then there is probably a problem with resources than
      need to be manually fixed, then issue ContinueUpdateRollback API from the
      console.
    </p>

    <h2>Changeset</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When you update a stack, you can use a ChangeSet to see what changes
        will be applied ahead of time for greater confidence.
      </li>
      <li>A ChangeSet won't indicate if the update will be successful.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Drift</h3>
    <p>
      CloudFormation doesn't protect against manual changes, so someone could
      delete or edit a resource manually that is defined in our CloudFormation
      configuration. If our infrastructure has changed from our CloudFormation
      configuration, this is called drift. We can use CloudFormation Drift
      Detection to see if drift has occurred. Drift shows the difference between
      the expected and actual state of resources.
    </p>

    <h2>Nested Stacks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Are stacks that are part of other stacks.</li>
      <li>
        Allow you to isolate repeated patterns and common components in stacks
        and call them from other stacks.
      </li>
      <li>Considered best practice.</li>
      <li>Often used with a load balancer or security group.</li>
      <li>To update a nested stack, update the parent (root stack).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cross Stack vs Nested STack</h2>
    <p><strong>Cross Stack:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Helpful when stacks have different lifecycles.</li>
      <li>Use exports and imports to share values.</li>
      <li>
        When you need to pass exported values from one template to another.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Nested Stacks:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Used when components must be reused, such as an ALB.</li>
      <li>
        The nested stack is only important to the higher-level stack and is not
        shared.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Service Role</h2>
    <p>
      IAM role that allows CloudFormation to create/update/delete stack
      resourced on your behalf. Gives ability to users to create/update/delete
      stack resources even if they don't have permissions to work with the
      resources directly in the stack.
    </p>
    <p>User must have the <code>iam:PassRole</code> permission.</p>
    <img
      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-service-role.png"
    />

    <h2>Capabilities</h2>
    <p>
      <code>CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM</code> and <code>CAPABILITY_IAM</code> are
      necessary when CloudFormation templates are creating or updating IAM
      resources, <code>CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM</code> is required if the resourced
      are named.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND</code> is necessary when your CloudFormation
      template includes Macros or Nested Stacks to perform dynamic
      transformations. Your template may change before deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>InsufficientCapabilitiesException</code> exception will be thrown by
      CloudFormation if the capabilities have not been acknowledged when
      deploying a template as a security measure.
    </p>

    <h2>DeletionPolicy</h2>
    <p>
      Controls what happens when the CLoudFormation template is deleted, by
      default all the resources are deleted when the template is deleted. If you
      want to you can explicitly set the DeletionPolicy. Delete will not apply
      to an S3 bucket unless the bucket is empty.
    </p>
    <img
      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-deletion-policy.png"
    />
    <p>
      You can set <code>Retain</code> as the DeletionPolicy such as not deleting
      a database as you want to keep the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also a <code>Snapshot</code> deletion policy which takes a final
      snapshot of the resource before deleting it.
    </p>

    <h2>Stack Policies</h2>
    <p>
      By default during a CloudFormation Stack update, all updates are allowed
      on all resources. A Stack Policy is a JSON document that defines the
      update actions that are allowed on a specific resource during Stack
      updates.
    </p>
    <p>This can protect resources from unintentional updates.</p>
    <p>
      When you create a Stack Policy all resources are now protected by default,
      you then set an explicit <code>ALLOW</code> for the resources you want to
      allow to be updated.
    </p>
    <img
      src="https://aws-developer-associate-notes-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-stack-policy.png"
    />

    <h2>Termination Protection</h2>
    <p>To prevent accidental deletes of our CloudFormation stacks.</p>

    <h2>Custom Resources</h2>
    <p>
      Is used to define resources that are not yet supported by CloudFormation
      or to define custom provision logic for your resources that can be outside
      of CloudFormation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have custom scripts run during create/update/delete through Lambda
      functions such as running a Lambda function to delete every object in an
      S3 bucket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Defined in the template using
      <code>AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource</code> or
      <code>Custom::&lt;MyCustomResourceTypeName&gt;</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Defined a custom resource using a ServiceToken which specifies where
      CLoudFormation sends requests to such as Lambda or SNS, this is required
      and must be in the same region. Input parameters are also optional.
    </p>

    />

    <h2>StackSet</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Create, update, or delete stacks across multiple accounts and regions
        with a single operation.
      </li>
      <li>Administrator account to create StackSets.</li>
      <li>
        Trusted accounts to create, update, and delete stack instances from
        StackSets.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you update a StackSet, all associated stack instances are updated
        throughout all accounts and regions. Can be applied into all accounts of
        an AWS Organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        Only Administrator account or DelegatedAdministrator can create
        StackSets.
      </li>
    </ul>
